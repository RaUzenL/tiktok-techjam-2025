Bennie Restaurant & Bar,8.0,Óóä
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"If you want amazing food in a laid back atmosphere highly recommend. The lamb rack was really tender, octopus was delicious and cooked perfectly and highly recommend the salmon tartare, so fresh! I agree with others that the branding makes it seem like another trashy chain restaurant but the reality was v different on arrival. It is a laid back atmosphere so don't expect michelin star service but the food was one of my favourite eats in London all year and all done to a great standard."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,4.0,"Bennie Restaurant and Bar ‚Äî a small and quiet spot with friendly service. The La Plancha king prawns were tasty and well-cooked, though the scallops fell a bit short of expectations. A cozy place for a casual bite, but not a must-return. Maybe it‚Äôs better for Breakfast."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"European fusion from France to Georgia. A great selection of wines. The baked zucchini flowers are unforgettable! Lovely live music and excellent service. We celebrated a birthday here, and it felt incredibly cozy and warm."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Firstly, a huge thanks and praise to Adi who was very attentive, helpful and provided 5-stars standards service us! He is a superstar especially with his recommendations. While we first thought our table by the door & DJ was not the best, we got to enjoy where we were in the end. The food from starters to dessert was delectable! Compliments to the chef and team. Anastasia was also provided a great service. Definitely a place we‚Äôre going to dine again in the future and will highly recommend."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Can‚Äôt fault a thing, great decor with also a few seats out front, food was great I very much enjoyed the octopus with a delicious chimichurri sauce complementing the sweet potato pur√©e extremely well (the cheesecake dessert was perhaps a bit underwhelming), but really the service is worth calling out, the waiters even offered another cocktail on the house! Thank you and will be back."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Out of this world food ,service, drinks a made by bartender who is very creative and professional, thank you Vlad.
Atmosphere is amazing and changes depending on the time of the day. DEFINITELY my Favorite spot to eat in London."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Bennie's Restaurant and Bar offers a delightful dining experience. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, perfect for a casual meal or a more celebratory occasion. The menu features a good selection of dishes, with a focus on fresh, high-quality ingredients. I particularly enjoyed the scallops and steak. The portions were generous, and the presentation was appealing. Service was attentive and friendly, making the entire meal a pleasant experience. A definite recommendation for those looking for a satisfying and enjoyable dining experience in London."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Great spot in the heart of Fitzrovia, food was absolutely delicious from starters ü•óto cocktails üç∏ , welcoming was super cozy, service was excellent. Highly recommend for date nights, brunch and family gatherings üëçüß°"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"The look of the actual menu online doesn't do this place justice (a 90s looking diners menu but a clean, spacious restaurant in person). We were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant today and enjoyed a team lunch for 10 people. Food was great quality, staff were friendly and we also enjoyed a discounted price due to booking online. Would definitely return and no complaints on food. Serving sizes were large as well, which was a plus. Great for big groups and those with dietary requirements"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"The food was delicious and good presentation. I would recommend it. Price is good, the portion size fills you up nicely."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Had some lovely seafood pasta here and my friend loved her food as well. Service was good and friendly. Would definitely return.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Delicious food and good service in a pretty setting.
The braised lamb is a must, so tender. Also really enjoyed the beef short rib and fried aubergine. Crispy mushrooms did not disappoint either - they lived up to the name!
Also got the short rib, burrata and fries which were more than enough.
Would recommend!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Was sceptical before booking even though this restaurant had been recommend to me by my dear friend and fellow-foodie-cum-dining-companion.

However, right from the moment our friendly waiter (without being too friendly) made some menu suggestions and was amenable to making changes (like offering the delicious pea and mint soup dairy-free), we knew we might be in for a treat!

The said soup was soup-er (better than this dreadful pun, let me assure you) and was seasoned delightfully, presented beautifully (as were all dishes) and if you wanted to add some Himalayan pink, rock salt or black pepper you could reach for the very original and charming twisters that dispensed both with appealing ease..

My friend's octopus on a sweet-potato puree base pleased her considerably, my cauliflower dish made what could otherwise have been a rather bland main perfectly enjoyable (and, generous a serving, too).  Fries were cooked to perfection and extremely plentiful (probably the biggest side portion we have ever had).

By the time it came to dessert, the thrill factor increased further!  My friend, who is originally from Ukraine, noted that the honey cake resembled the ones she grew up eating and started to suffer from a case of cake envy (as well as nostalgia) even though she liked her pistachio cheese cake.   Teas were served in rather charming, somewhat rustic cups and saucers and our second server was an endearingly sweet young girl who was equally friendly and professional as the first person.

All in all, this is a restaurant that does not need to try hard, has no pretensions to wow with interior decor gimmicks, even though there is nothing faulty with its simple but pleasing scheme.  Yet, I can confidently declare that far from the food being 'average' as some reviews have erroneously claimed, this is on the good to outstanding spectrum (including the Merlot glass of wine that we sipped throughout).

It's not cheap but it's not expensive and bearing in mind the location, the quality, beauty of presentation and delicate range of flavours on offer, I don't think one should grumble; one should let Bennie's food crumble with considerable contentment in the mouth!

We will be returning for sure and I commend those, like me, who might be unsure, to give it a try as I did!  You will love it!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Newly launched restaurant. Very comfortable and you feel the family vibe - rare occasion in Central London. Got some great dishes from European cuisine. Even if you are not fan of cauliflower, just go for it - they have done something incredible with it! And duck was amazing. Can‚Äôt wait to be back to try the rest of the items in the menu."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Met a coworker here for brunch, as we are both in London on personal holidays. Saw the good reviews and central location for us both and it was a good pick. We were the only ones at 1030, which was nice because we could chit chat and not feel rushed. Our server was sweet and we both loved our avocado toasts with poached eggs."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"We had very pleasant late lunch at Bennie's. Super attentive service. Tasty menu, my Pork Belly was tender and flavoursome. Also margaritas with Patron were top notch. Thanks a lot! Highly recommend and will visit again for sure."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Had a private dinner at Bennies and it was beautiful. The decor was the highlight, my guests loved the mirrors and the calming atmosphere. The food was nice, the quantity could‚Äôve been abit more on the plate but other than that it was amazing. The staff were friendly and accommodating! Definitely recommend"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,4.0,"Decided to come here for lunch. Restaurant does both brunch and ala carte dishes. Went for the grilled prawns and beef tartare. Service was fast on serving and the prawns were fresh. The main was a little bit disappointed. The grilled salmon, though was done perfect way but there isn‚Äôt any sauce go with this dish. There was some honey mustard that goes to the salad. We did request for additional mustard but didn‚Äôt get any. The pork belly, was hoping a bit crispy skin but just happened to be braised pork. It came with one side and selected sweet potato chips to go with. I think the carbonara saved the day for a bit with the combination of the cream, raw egg cracked to give a bit sticky creamy texture. The bill came and there was scan to pay but additional charge of 0.99 for doing so rather than covered part of it. Overall, nothing too memorable at this restaurant itself."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"We came here for Brunch. We had Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon and a Berry Meringue Roulade. Both are over the top dishes: perfectly balanced, great portion and rich in flavour. The service is excellent and the armosphere relax and warm."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"We went there on a saturday evening.
The service was great! They interacted politely, asking questions, and were up for a small chat.
The music and atmosphere were nice and cozy. Downstairs there was a party going on in the private room, but you could barely notice it!
The place is clean and looks very aesthetically pleasing. We had a comfortable seating area
The food was delicious! and honestly served like it came from a michelin star restaurant. For dessert I had the Pistachio cheesecake, which was divine. Defenitely recommend it!

If we care to being critical, just as everywhere else in London, they standardly have a 12.5% tip added to your bill. Additionally, we didn't receive a spoon when a pasta was ordered.

All in all, especially considering the price, great experience! You'd expect the bill to be way higher!
Definitely recommend going here and whenever I'll visit London again, I'll come back for sure!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"During my recent brunch at Bennie Restaurant and Bar, I decided to mix and match by ordering both the Eggs Benedict and the Avocado on Toast. This turned out to be an excellent choice that showcased the restaurant‚Äôs flair for classic brunch dishes with a modern twist.

The Eggs Benedict were spot on, featuring perfectly poached eggs with a runny yolk that complemented the rich, creamy hollandaise sauce. The English muffin was toasted to perfection, providing a nice contrast in texture. What set this dish apart was the quality of the ingredients ‚Äì the ham was flavorful and added just the right amount of saltiness to balance the dish.

On the other hand, the Avocado on Toast was equally impressive. The avocado was creamy and fresh, spread generously on a slice of perfectly toasted sourdough. The addition of pomegranate seeds was a delightful surprise, adding a burst of sweetness and a slight crunch that elevated the dish. A sprinkle of chili flakes added a mild heat, making each bite interesting and flavorful.

Combining these two dishes offered a wonderful variety of flavors and textures, making for a satisfying and well-rounded brunch. The ambiance of Bennie, with its large windows letting in natural light and the cozy yet stylish decor, made the experience even more enjoyable. The friendly and attentive staff ensured that my coffee cup was never empty and that the dining experience was seamless.

Overall, my brunch at Bennie Restaurant and Bar was delightful. The combination of Eggs Benedict and Avocado on Toast is highly recommended for those who want to enjoy the best of both worlds. Bennie‚Äôs inviting atmosphere and top-notch service make it a perfect spot for a relaxed and delicious brunch in London."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Our food was excellent and the presentation was super pretty. The restaurant is also a vibeee and we enjoyed dining in. Highly recommend.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,"Hasan was an exceptional waiter who made our visit truly enjoyable. From the moment we arrived, he greeted us with a warm smile and guided us to our table with genuine hospitality. Throughout the meal, he was attentive, polite, and knowledgeable about the menu, offering helpful suggestions without being pushy. The restaurant itself had a cozy and inviting atmosphere, with soft lighting, comfortable seating, and a pleasant buzz of conversation that made it perfect for a relaxed evening out. Hasan‚Äôs excellent service, combined with the welcoming vibe of the place, made for a memorable dining experience.
And of course the place was a nice and quiet one I felt relief eating there after a tired full busy day really appreciate it"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"The food here is DELICIOUS! First had wings and calamari, lovely!

Then for my mains I had ‚ÄòBraised Beef Short Rib‚Äô OMG, how tender and scrumptious was this, loved every bit of it.

I recommend this restaurant and thank you Wowcher for this great deal and for the excellent customer service. Will definitely be coming back here."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Love this place! Cosy stylish atmosphere, friendly staff, good service, tasty food and drinks üëèüèª"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Had an amazing time at Bennie for dinner! The food was amazing, very tasty and well presented. The staff were friendly and were happy to give us recommendations on cocktails and dishes. The atmosphere was perfect for a catch up with friends. Will definitely be back"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I had the pleasure of enjoying a late lunch at Bennie‚Äôs on Saturday, and it was an absolute delight from start to finish. Coincidentally, it was International Women‚Äôs Day and the restaurant added a truly thoughtful touch by presenting all the women dining there a beautiful white rose‚Äîa small but incredibly meaningful gesture that made the experience even more special.

From the moment I walked in, I was met with warm and welcoming service. The ambiance was simply brilliant‚Äîa perfect balance of sophisticated yet cozy, making it an ideal spot to unwind and enjoy a fantastic meal. Speaking of which, the food? Flawless. Every dish was prepared with precision, bursting with rich flavors and beautifully presented.

The service was attentive without being intrusive and the staff made sure every detail was just right. It‚Äôs rare to find a restaurant that nails ambiance, service and food all at once, but Bennie‚Äôs does it effortlessly.

I‚Äôm already looking forward to my next visit‚Äîthis is the kind of place that leaves a lasting impression. Highly recommend!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Fantastic full English breakfast!  Really good quality, at a very good price (by Central London standards)"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I recently dined at Bennie and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. Situated on a bustling street, Bennie radiates a cozy, inviting atmosphere that instantly relaxes you.

As I entered, I received a warm greeting from the hostess and was promptly seated. The interior struck a perfect balance of elegance and comfort, with soft lighting and tasteful decor creating a welcoming ambiance. The staff were remarkable throughout the evening ‚Äì attentive, friendly, and well-versed in the menu options.

The highlight of my visit was the apple strudel with ice cream. This dessert was a culinary delight, marrying the sweetness of the apples with a buttery, flaky pastry. Paired with the creamy ice cream, each bite was a heavenly experience. It wasn't just a dessert; it was a masterpiece of flavors and textures.

Overall, my visit to Bennie was nothing short of fantastic. The blend of excellent service, delightful ambiance, and exceptional cuisine made for an unforgettable dining experience. I highly recommend Bennie to anyone seeking a special night out or a place to celebrate an important occasion."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Amazing service! Will be back. Anastasia is as super attentive as well as the rest of the staff. Live music was great. Spasibo ü´∂üèΩ
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,"Came to Bennie's for my Dad & friend's birthday. Decent atmosphere & highly recommend their beef tartare. However, what let Bennie's down was the service being quite slow. When we ordered our drinks, it took quite a long time (about 20+ minutes) & our food came at different times leaving half of the group to start eating without the others, & the side plates for some of the food came afterwards which made it debatable to pay the service charge. But overall it was a decent experience, but for the money we paid it could've been better."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I stumbled upon this restaurant travelling with my parents. It's a 10-minute walk from Oxford Street. The interior is modern, and they serve food all day from breakfast to dinner.

üåü Salmon Tartare üí∞¬£12
üåü Chicken Skewer üí∞¬£9
üåü Charcuterie Board üí∞¬£11

Each dish was delicious! The salmon tartare was very fresh, with perfectly ripe avocado. The chicken thigh and chorizo skewers were tender and juicy, and the charcuterie board was a generous portion at a very reasonable price.

üåü Beef Ribs üí∞¬£29
üåü Beef Cheek üí∞¬£20
üåü Grilled Beef Salad üí∞¬£14.5

The portions of the three main dishes were incredibly large. The beef ribs were a bit dry, but the seasoning was great. The beef cheek was braised very tenderly and tasted fantastic! The salad featured tender grilled beef, and the mustard sauce was appetizing‚Äîhighly recommended!

üç∑ A pint of beer was ¬£6.5

Overall, it was very affordable! Considering the location and the ambiance, good value for money.

Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Visited on 13 April 2024 with the family for breakfast and would highly recommend. We had three full breakfasts and one eggs Benedict with mushroom, four drinks, and everything was excellent. It was fairly quiet when we went as it had just opened but can imagine its buzzing when busier. Will definitely visit again."

Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Lovely restaurant. Fantastic food. Attentive waitress. Beautiful atmosphere. Melt in the mouth steak. Good size portions.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Went for breakfast, the food is incredible, the bacon was just the right thickness and everything was beautifully presented. I also followed it with the cheesecake and oh wow, this is by far the best cheesecake I have ever eaten!! Incredible, will be coming back for more."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Good food, quick service. Nice brunch experience. The lighting and ambience are nice. We‚Äôll be back to try out the dinner"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,Food was well presented but a bit bland. Dessert was nice. Main problem was they charged us extra to use a QR code to pay and then asked us to tip on top of the service charge :(
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Super nice and calm place if you wanna get away from the noise of SOHO. Amazing food and drink. Highly recommended if you are in central london
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Excellent food and experience. A great spot that has thoughtfully prepared their menu. Had the pork belly and it was delicious. Well worth the visit!

we popped in for cocktails and had some lside dishes too.
Very clean and quick service
The decor is beautiful too"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Very tasty place! We ordered several starters and main courses. I really liked the roasted broccoli and baby potatoes, wow! I also recommend the duck. I've never eaten anything so tasty and juicy! And their riesling is very tasty!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Lovely interior, reasonable prices and amazing food - the cheesecake in particular was to die for, it was by far the best one we‚Äôve ever tried! Very talented chefs, would highly recommend."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"A fresh feel to Great Portland Street, the decor in the restaurant is amazing and creates a very chilled but vibrant atmosphere. I had a light lunch with a friend of mine and the food was faultless (highly recommend eggs Benedict with pork belly) I am really looking forward to try out Bennies of an evening because the rest of the menu looked delicious! I would give a rating of 10 stars if I could."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Great service, very attentive. Cocktails great and food good and well presented and very nice."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,4.0,Surprisingly good to be fair. Don't be fooled by the poor visually looking menu as the food is great.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Perfect place!Had dinner on NYE!great music,great service and lots of smiling faces üôÇ a must visit"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Food and coffee were great.  Service and atmosphere were really good as well.  Definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,perfect birthday lunch!! really helpful staff and darina was amazing. lovely food definitely coming again !
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,We reserved a table for 11 people on New Year's Eve. Everything worked perfectly. The food tasted great and was served at the same time - so we could all eat together. The drinks service was just as quick and perfect. The price was also reasonable for London. We'd love to come back!
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I just visited yesterday for brunch to celebrate my 60 th birthday. The food was amazing, the waitress was amazing and so professional, the lovely birthday cake with Candle was a lovely touch and I would recommend this place as it‚Äôs excellent and a beautiful place xx"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,"Promising 3.
Would return to have cocktail and steal tar tar.
Lunch offer menu not offered, I had to ask.  It was then given - Not sure if it was genuinely forgotten or intentionally not given. Not asked about allergies/ intolerance but I understand this can be forgotten.
Either way, a bad start.

Steak tar tar 10/10, nor served straight from the fridge like in some establishments.
Aubergene was very good, not oiley or heavily battered.

Brocolli tempura was crispy around the stem. However, dissapointingly,  the floret sections were dense with dough.

Would prefer the immediate entrance area to be the white and green colour scheme to make it more daytime friendly as I wouldn't return to breakfast or lunch here in the summer months.
Good use of mirrors throughout and does pull off the orange colour scheme without connotations of Easy-Jet.

Payment is preferred via QR for which there is a ¬£1 at platform charge in addition to the 12.5 service free. You are then also offered to tip.
Seems unethical to me, as if paying in haste etc., one could easily add this. Would also like the option to remove service fee which can only be done through verbal request.

Presently would recommend it for evenings only.
There are 3 different fonts used on external signage.
The door handle when entering is too close to the other door that your knuckles are grazed.
Music is good and appropriate to the setting.

I will return for nightimg cocktails and to see if the mains will warrant the same praise as the starters.

If you like Ottolenghi you would like it here.
Will give the benefit of the doubt as i would like to believe there is honesty in the service here and that the lunch offer menu was genuinely forgotten.

Because of the brocolli I left feeling hungry. The redeeming feature was the steak tar tar"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"The most amazing eggs with pork belly in London, and I guess also in the world. Must try."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Friendly staff and delicious food. We had a great dinner here.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"An incredibly underrated gem of a restaurant, nice chill vibe and outstanding food and service - especially by the waitress Galina and bartender Vlad. Would highly recommend and will for sure be back."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,Went based on Google reviews but it was just OK. Strange menu and was very quiet on a Saturday night. Had pasta and parmesan not offered and then it took about 5 mins for it to come. Not sure why it had good rating. Portion size was quite small for the price. Also sweet potato chips on menu but they didn't have any
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,2.0,"Quite disappointing, sadly!

Brought 8 people for my birthday (notified in the booking) on Saturday 8th Feb. We did arrive 15 minutes late, although I called ahead to notify, which they said was absolutely fine. The restaurant was not busy (3 tables with 2-4 guests per table).

Minimal atmosphere, loud and cheesy cover pop song covers. Food wasn't quick and service was poor; no wine menus on the table with the other menus, then 4 given judiciously between 8(?). I asked for olive oil and balsamic vinegar to go with our bread, but they didn't come, saying they don't offer table olive oil or balsamic vinegar - how about on a plate? I asked for a burrata starter (which, while on the menu in other dishes, wasn't sold alone, so they declined that too). How hard is it to put a burrata on a plate with a little olive oil? Although well presented, the food was only okay in flavour. King prawns were great, but my monkfish was overcooked, and portion sizes were a little on the stingy side.

I eat out quite a bit, and really don't expect much, but when it's your birthday, you'd hope service would ensure it's at least going well? No happy birthday on arrival, no above and beyond? No problem, I just won't come again, sadly."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,4.0,"The starters and main courses were excellent, the desserts less so, especially the chocolate brownie which was so dry nobody could eat it.
The place is nice, not ideal for our group because there were too many of us and the restaurant is shaped so that people at different tables can't quite see each other, but for a smaller group would have been good.
I don't see it in the list but I had the mushroom burger and it was excellent."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"What a lovely experience! Great food and coffee, friendly staff and very nicely designed interior. Definitely coming back."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I had a great time in this little restaurant right in the heart of central London. The food was amazing from the start to finish.
Starters, steak and dessert were cooked to perfection."

Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Food was 1st class, service excellent and great value for money. Highly recommend"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Just wanted to say bennie‚Äôs the best restaurant ever !!! I booked the private room for my birthday event last night and honestly it was so beautiful the staff were amazing they was very patient and catering to us . Would defo recommend here again and will definitely come back again. Thank you so much for making my birthday amazing !!!
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Great spot for some good food. Had the pan fried salmon and mushroom risotto.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,2.0,"We were sat by the door and of course as people come and go the cold air wafts in. Not a deal breaker but provides further explanation to the overall score.

Food was OK. I had the Beef tartar to start, tasted nice, looked nostalgic, which was fitting for the restaurant as it has a throwback feel. I had a prawn and crab pasta, which was a bit dry and I thought lacking in crab and just three king prawns. ¬£20.

Service was OK, nothing to praise or complain about. I don‚Äôt think I would return here."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Great food and really friendly and attentive service.

Thanks to Vlad and the team for a nice evening."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Recently visited this restaurant for a work lunch.
Service and food were top notch.
Will be returning."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Ambiance and restaurant is amazing! Went here today with my friend. I really loved the food. We had dine in for brunch. Very friendly staff. We gave a her a tip because she is so nice.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Cocktail, prawns and beef tar tar was yummy. Nice, beautiful and calm place. Staff is welcome"
Piccolino Exchange Square,16.0,Óóä
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We had the beef lasagna and beef ragu, it is one of the best ones we have ever had! It‚Äôs full of flavour, soft and melts in your mouth. I could come here every day for the lasagna, it has a truffle flavour, homemade pasta! We have been twice now and will be coming back! Lovely location and excellent service. Thank you!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"This is my second time have been here and I decided to leave a 5 stars review.

The restaurant it‚Äôs pretty, really good for special occasions especially and they have friendly staff to serve you the best food. I ordered crab meat ravioli this time, and the sauce was quite unique which add an extra point to the dish. Surprisingly the portion was bigger than I thought !!

I had good food and experience for the both time I went !"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Piccolo Exchange is one of those rare places that instantly makes you feel both welcome and intrigued. The food is creative, beautifully presented, and full of flavor this is truly something special.

A real highlight of the evening was the pistachio tuile: paper-thin, nutty, with just the right hint of sweetness and a touch of berry glaze. It‚Äôs the kind of thoughtful detail that sums up the whole experience.

Special mention to Fadil our server who made the night even better. Warm, knowledgeable and effortlessly attentive - he brought a personal touch that made us feel genuinely cared for.

Whether you‚Äôre there for a cozy dinner or a celebration, Piccolo Exchange offers something memorable. Highly recommended!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"The drinks were really good - my mocktail was not too sweet and great flavor. The food was all decently good flavor, I think the presentation can be better. The dessert was ok - could be that my expectations were too high as the Tiramisu was highly recommended by people. In general, very pleasant dinning experience."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We went to Piccolino just for a drink, but the place was so nice we decided to stay for dinner‚Äîand we‚Äôre glad we did! The atmosphere was really welcoming, the drinks were great, and the food was delicious. The staff were friendly and made us feel right at home. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"I came here the first time and was served a very salty carbonara that was not to the standard i keep this restaurant at. After making a review about my experience, i was approached by their team in Google and they asked me to give them a second chance, assuring that this was a one-time occurrence.
I had a conversation with the manager over the phone and we agreed on another day.
I went there today and was left nothing but happy.
The carbonara came perfectly salty and it tasted even better with their house wine.
Will definitely be back.

The first picture is from the first time and the second picture from today."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Absolutely loved the experience at Piccolino Exchange Square! The atmosphere is elegant yet welcoming, perfect for a relaxed lunch or a classy evening out. The service was top-notch attentive without being intrusive. I had the seafood linguine and it was bursting with flavor, perfectly cooked. The wine selection is impressive too, with great pairing recommendations from the staff. Definitely one of the best Italian dining spots in Manchester. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"If you are looking for exceptional service, great food and an amazing vibe then this is definitely one to visit. I‚Äôve been a regular for many years and cannot recommend highly enough! Fadil is also a great new addition to the team!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"The prawn starters were amazing, the main courses were standard. Service and atmosphere is really good, if you are around good spot to grab dinner.."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We had an absolutely incredible experience at Piccolino Liverpool Street! From the moment we arrived, the service was exceptional. Serena the hostess she was very welcoming, Fabio, the restaurant manager, made us feel so welcome, ensuring that every detail of our visit was perfect.

At the bar, Maurizio prepared some of the best cocktails we've ever had ‚Äî his recommendations were spot on and added a special touch to our evening.

And the food ‚Äî simply outstanding! Every dish was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and bursting with flavor. You can tell how much passion and skill goes into his cooking ‚Äî it made our dining experience unforgettable.

If you're looking for a place that combines fantastic food, outstanding service, and a warm atmosphere, Piccolino Liverpool Street is the place to go. We can't wait to return!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"What I liked most about the restaurant that we were not rushed to order or to leave. We ended up spending 3 hours, sat outside on a wonderful summer warm day. A table was booked in advance, but there were lots of tables available indoors. We were served by very friendly staff. The food is good and options for vegetarians are available. Prices are London prices, so expect to pay ¬£70 each for mains and drinks."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"The food is delicious, the staff are wonderful, and if you let them, they're really funny and will interact with your table making your meal a wonderful experience.

To get here from Liverpool St Station, follow the escalator to the upper concourse towards the bus station, past the M&S, tanning salon and Moshi Moshi and the down Sun Terrace up to Exchange Plaza. It can be a bit difficult to find otherwise (not the restaurant's fault)."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"An amazing hidden gem of a location and venue for corporate events, social gatherings and even family dining.

A little tricky to find via Google maps but if you head towards the back end of Liverpool Street station (facing the platforms, walk on the upper mezzanine level) you will soon see exchange square.

The restaurant has a lovely private dining room overlooking the main restaurant which I am using for a corporate dinner.

Highly recommended beautifully decorated Italian restaurant well worth a visit."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Domenico was an amazing waiter and bartender! Not only was he incredibly attentive and professional, but he also made our experience so much fun with his great sense of humor. He gave excellent recommendations and really went above and beyond to ensure we had a fantastic time. Highly recommend asking for him‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,2.0,"Came here with the Club IR 50% off offer - otherwise the prices are very high for what it is.

I was very disappointed with the arancini (it was almost cold), and the other dishes were only average.

The staff really very attentive though and it‚Äôs a very large space."
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"The location was stunning and general service was good. However, the waiter at our table was not attentive and rather abrupt, we found the food poor value for money and there was no gluten free pizza despite the menu stating there was. Disappointing I‚Äôm afraid so I would not recommend it."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Piccolini Exchange Square last night.

I ordered the Caesar salad ‚Äì not the most traditional Italian choice, I know ‚Äì but it was excellent. Unlike most places, their version came generously topped with chicken, which made it feel like a proper meal rather than just a starter.

We sat outside to enjoy the surrounding garden seating area, even though it is in the middle of a building complex the incredible planting makes it feel like you are somewhere else! As the evening cooled down, we moved under the heated seating area. It was a really nice touch to be able to stay warm while still enjoying the outdoor setting. Dessert was the perfect finish ‚Äì the pistachio panna cotta was absolutely incredible.

A special mention to the waiting staff, all of whom were friendly and attentive. One gentleman in particular ‚Äì dark hair and what sounded like a strong Italian accent ‚Äì was especially helpful and made us feel very well looked after.

All in all, a brilliant evening. I‚Äôm already looking forward to visiting the new Tower Bridge location soon!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Piccolino is a great place to eat and drink. The food is fresh, tasty, and well made, with lots of classic Italian dishes. The drinks, including cocktails and wine, go really well with the food. It‚Äôs a nice place to relax and enjoy a good meal."
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"It's a pleasant restaurant situated in a very busy area of the city hence the prices are far higher than the quality of the food.

Ordered the pork arincini balls for starters which was faultless. Ordered the Branzino fish for my main which I thought was a small portion. Nevertheless it was filling and it tasted good. It did some with chips and some boiled veg which were nothing amazing.  One of my friends ordered the mushroom risotto which they were happy with.

For dessert ordered the chocolate ganache which was very good. I would recommend a visit but be wary of the price."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Had a private dining experience. The fish was amazing and the other food, steaks, vegetarian options starters and desserts all looked amazing great feedback. Tiramisu was epic and prosecco went down a treat"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"üìù Mixed feelings about this Italian restaurant that partly disappointed expectations after seeing such good ratings. Prices were acceptable though.

üç¥ Food I tried was ok, even pretty good I'd say, not mindblowing. I had some antipasti, fish with side veggies and budino di panettone for dessert: no complaints with anything I had. Tasted well. The lobster pasta my colleagues had didn't look great to be honest which they confirmed after eating it.

üìç It's located close to Liverpool Street station. Decor was ok, kind of modern. The music was a bit loud... at the limit to allow a group conversation at the table.

‚òùüèº Service wasn't good enough: they were polite but for instance nobody cleaned the table before serving dessert... really not great."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We chose this restaurant to celebrate our friend birthday. We had such a great time. Food was delicious and service even better. We set outside and they looked after us without being intrusive. Great suggestions and the tramis√π was so authentic. We had mainly wine, but cocktails also were great. Fadil, our server gave us the best service we could ask, attentive and professional. Highly raccomended. Will be back soon."
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"Poor service without a smile, and extremely rude bar staff. Came here for a Christmas work lunch, and the unseasoned steak (which I paid extra for) was a very poor cut of meat; half of it was gristle. Chips were soggy and vegetables burnt. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Spent some great time there.. the food was pretty good but what I liked the most was the staff who really took care of you.. very friendly and polite. The steak could have been a little better but the dessert more than made up for it!
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Great Italian restaurant located in Exchange Square (just behind Liverpool Street Station). Staff were attentive and friendly.

Huge menu with a great selection of pastas. Opted for the Scallops for starter, Ravioli for main, and the Nutella tart for dessert. All cooked and presented well."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"One of the best Italians in London!
Authentic Italian cuisine at its best: absolute delicious food and extraordinary service - highly recommend and will definitely be back"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Great food and service. Fairly quiet on a Friday lunchtime, but that's central London these days.  The food was excellent, as was the service. I will definitely go back"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Been here before and decided to go again for our anniversary on Wednesday early evening. Had a few different dishes. All were delicious!! Will find another excuse to go back very soon. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food came pretty quickly which is always good.
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Nice spaghetti carbonara. Negroni was okay. Calamari was just okay, nice sauce though. Good cocktails. Coffee and ice cream desserts are a must. My highlight of the night
Decent place for a quick lunch or quick pre theatre meal as close to the station"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Had the fried calamari, vegan margherita and frutti di bosco for dessert. Service was attentive and respectful, glasses never ran empty and we weren't left waiting long for food at all. Excellent variety of quality wines to choose from.

Venue was exceptionally clean and very spacious with a comfortable outdoor seating area letting you enjoy a quiet space surrounded by the towering London skyline.

Only downside was the disappointing lack of good dairy free main courses. My pizza came with no dairy-free cheese replacement, they just removed the cheese from my food. Starter and desert were stellar on the other hand."
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,Really nice experience here midweek for work dinner for 16 people. Staff were really attentive. Relatively pricey food however the food was exceptional with many options. DJ in the bar area was nice however for the restaurant area it was quite loud. Would revisit as there are more dishes I need to try!
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,The beef shin ravioli and malbec wine was absolutely delicious. The service and vibes are very very nice. Good date spot or place to catch up with friends. Talal was our waiter and he was super lovely and attentive.
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"A big shout out to this place and the extra customer care they showed me this week.  I was there for drinks with customers before a dinner reservation but unfortunately forgot my card, which was behind the bar and of course this meant I had not paid either.  I called and spoke to the bar the following day to apologise and arrange payment and a colleague to stop by to pick up, however they insisted on posting the card back to me with the receipt from transaction too.  The following day, the card arrived special delivery at cost of ¬£10 to them, which I thought was amazing and very kind service.  I most certainly will head there when visiting same customer again.  Thank you team."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,I like this bar/restaurant. The food is good and during good weather you can eat outdoors. It's worth visiting if in the area.
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Popped in for dinner as they had a 50% off deal for members with the app. Service was great, staff were very attentive and food was brought out on time. I would say the food was hit and miss, some of us ordered the same dishes on the table and the portion sizes were a little mismatched which wasn‚Äôt great. The pasta dishes didn‚Äôt seem authentic at all, a lot of ‚Äúcream‚Äù added to most of them. I had the livers to start and the duck as a main which were both lovely, however the duck had a fair bit of gristle which put me off from finishing the meal. I would recommend this place for a catchup with friends or colleagues if the offer is still on but wouldn‚Äôt personally pay full price for what‚Äôs on offer."
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,Although the meal and the staff were pleasant enough. When a mouse emerged from the kitchen and ran across the restaurant and the staff did nothing apart from tell us thats what happens in London. Would not recommend unless you love mice.
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Food was nice, well seasoned, portions were however a little small. Service was average, long wait take the initial order could be more attentive."
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"Absolutely disgusting
Food is terrible
Paid ¬£70 in total, the starter was taken away before finished, the main was meant to be chicken, and bacon ceaser salad, well,  it was the worst salad I've ever had. Tried getting a table of 10 to pay upfront - including service charge before having a drink and food. Unbelievable, I would never ever return to this place. Shame, as the music is good and the restaurant looks really nice but the food is barely edible, and for the price disgusting!!!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Enjoyed my meal here. The waiter was really lovely. The bar was a bit weird though, it turned out that they gave the waiter a different bottle of wine to the one we ordered without telling us and then charged us for that on the bill... well they changed it in the end after we mentioned it, but it's a good idea to check the bill before paying here. Food was cooked well, prawns and langoustines were tasty."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"My first trip to London with my daughter and I was browsing Italian restaurants. I realized Piccolino from Harrogate (favorite restaurant) was right here near Shoreditch. I knew the menu would be amazing and the service would be top notch. Fadil was the best! Super attentive, great service! Piccolino is my favorite restaurant in the whole world and that‚Äôs coming from a NYer."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We went on a Tuesday around 5pm. It was quiet so had a drink at the bar before moving to the restaurant.  We ordered 2 x 25 layer lasagnes which I know is always excellent.  Unfortunately mine came out flat and looked unloved. They made us two news ones which were fabulous and didn't charge us for either.  They also gave us some Lemonicni to clear out pallets.
Service was impeccable and the atmosphere grew to quiet to cheery as the evening went on.  Loved every minute and we were looked after brilliantly. Probably the best Italian in the city!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,2.0,"I came for a bottomless brunch on the 8th of February as part of a friends 21st birthday. There was about 9 of us. This was the most awful experience i‚Äôve ever had at a bottomless brunch. The food was horrendous, cold and bland. I had the pizza and it wasn‚Äôt at all how it was described. The drinks top up rarely came round considered it was a ¬£60 brunch each and ¬£45 service charge altogether for the table. The service for drinks was disgraceful, I on several occasions had to go up to servers and ask them to refill our drinks. Their attitude was poor and there was a complete lack of customer service. Although the music was good. I wouldn‚Äôt come here again and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend it."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"The best dirty martini I‚Äôve ever had!! Amazing service, fast and efficient. Dom the manager, very knowledgable and welcoming! Will be coming back!!!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,Quality of food was ok. Very very slow service. I think you need to work on the speed of service during lunch time for the people who work in the city.
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"On a positive note our initial booking was for 2pm but due to train cancellations we were delayed- we contacted the restaurant to let them know and they honoured our booking for when we actually arrived. In hindsight I'd rather they hadn't, which would have saved us the effort.
It was pretty downhill from there. We travelled over an hour to London especially for this brunch... after the experience we had, I won't be rushing back.
On arrival we were given the bill to pay the remaining ticket fee before receiving our first drinks.Included in this bill was a ¬£35 service charge. I'm not opposed to paying a service charge at all, after I've experienced the service (if its been good). I politely asked for the 'optional' service charge to be removed for this payment, ensuring we will tip at the end if we see fit but this was met with a challenging attitude and took multiple back and forths
before the waiter accepted. They then proceeded to bring an incorrect round of drinks to our table.
Not a great start.
The food was nice enough, but table service was mediocre. None of our starter plates were cleared before our mains dumped on the table, making it very overcrowded. I had ordered an extra side of zucchini chips, which I paid a service charge for, only to later realise I never actually received them so can't comment if they were any good!
We also didn't receive our full time of bottomless drinks, were quite rudely told our time is up without any pre warning, then shortly after were told to leave and more or less chased off the premises as it was turning back into a normal restaurant. I understand there are set times, but this was around 5:40 when the event said until 6. We aren't rowdy girls either, at this point we were just sat at our table chatting as we could finally hear each other due to the music changing.
Atmosphere wise the music was good but so incredibly loud it was hard to hear the friend next to me during the bottomless. Definitely not the place to go for a well needed catch up over dinner and drinks.
I wouldn't usually bother with reviews but as far as my expectations for an event in London are concerned, this was all very disappointing. After looking through other reviews I see a lot of issues in common with past service."
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,Great place just around Liverpool Street station. Service could be more friendly and attentive.
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Wow, that's all I can say! I came here with colleagues for a pre Christmas social event and the team did not disappoint.

They were courteous from the door and throughout our entire time at the restaurant. The food was lovely - starter, main and dessert! Oh, the mocktail ""Tropic Like It's Hot"" was fantastic. Not a drop of ice to water down the drink - just the way it should be!

Our food orders were placed on place cards, so no one forgot their order on the night.  The team kept checking we were enjoying our meals. They catered to some colleagues who were vegetarian/vegan and catered to their needs as best as possible.

A lovely evening was had by all, and would recommend!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,We had chicken breast with goonki it was absolutely beautiful. The pizza was average. The house ros√© wine was lovely. It was fresh and fruity. I like the atmosphere with  the mint color interior. The vibe was lively and the staff were friendly
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Had great service from Talal - kept the aperols coming!! Coming back here for my birthday celebrations end of May!

Thank you so much - Holly & Clare"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Business lunche for 16 so a large group. Nice atmosphere, very clean. However the layout is such that the waiting staff have to lean over to adjust utensils and serve the food and drinks. Good menu selection, but none of us came away saying ""that was nice"". Actually the conversation was, ""did they turn the temperature down to get us to leave""? We could/should have eaten in the company canteen, our host from AWS wanted to treat us, same...."
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,Visited here for a team dinner. The chicken pasta was average as were the desserts. The tiramisu was the only standout item on the menu. Service can also use some work as we had to wait several minutes between any time from the staff visited our table
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Piccolino in Exchange Square, and it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. The ambiance is charming, offering a perfect blend of elegance and comfort. However, what truly made our evening memorable was the exceptional service provided by our server, Mary.

From the moment we were seated, Mary was incredibly attentive, ensuring that every detail of our meal was perfect. Her warm and friendly demeanor made us feel welcome and valued as guests. She had an excellent knowledge of the menu and offered fantastic recommendations that made our dining experience even more delightful.

Mary was always available when we needed her, yet never intrusive, striking the perfect balance in customer service. Her attentiveness and genuine care for our satisfaction truly set her apart.

The food, as always at Piccolino, was delicious and beautifully presented. Each dish was a testament to the culinary expertise of the kitchen staff. But it was Mary's exemplary service that elevated our visit from a great meal to an unforgettable evening.

If you're looking for a dining experience where you'll be treated with utmost care and enjoy wonderful food, I highly recommend Piccolino in Exchange Square. And if you're lucky enough to have Mary as your server, you're in for an exceptional treat. Thank you, Mary, for making our night special!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"Typical italian, rude staff and very average to low food.

Soon to be closed i think.

Managers unbelievably rude and arrogant.

Not recommend"
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"My daughter has just been to this venue for her birthday for a bottomless brunch, they had to pay upfront and have been served only two drinks in an hour!! Then had the cheek to try charge them ¬£70 service charge. Clearly the staff have seen a young group of girls as an easy target for money. Disgusting"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Great atmosphere and attentive staff! Food was great too.
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Good food good a presentation, beautiful restaurant, staff as always great service"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Really cosy place to get drinks after work in a hidden leafy garden tucked behind Liverpool st station. Escape the rush, chill in the cosy al fresco seating. Especially enjoyed the non alcoholic cocktails which were only ¬£5. Will definitely be back! Great customer service too."
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Lovely location, nice staff, just on the pricier end for fairly simple food (pizzas/pasta etc). We did all however enjoy our food and I would go back. The courgette fries were amazing, the dessert though was too rich, even between 4 we didn't finish it (and we like sweet stuff!)"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Talal looked after us today and his service was amazing, he looked after us and made sure we had everything we needed ! Will definitely be coming back !!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"I want to say thank you very much for saving my birthday! I booked a table at another establishment and everything was very bad, we left after 5 minutes of being there. When we arrived at this establishment, we were greeted very warmly. The hostess was very friendly, the manager was simply magical, the waiters and runners were simply wonderful. I want to say a special thank you to Andrea and Angelo (I'm not sure I spelled their names correctly, sorry), they were absolutely wonderful. I definitely recommend this place to everyone! Thank you very much to the whole team, I am very grateful for this evening!!!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Went here for a Birthday and had a fantastic time great food options along with good drinks service, the atmosphere was amazing and got everyone up dancing.

Would highly recommend for a girls brunch or mixed gender groups.

Would definitely go again."
Piccolino Exchange Square,2.0,"Food  was just ok and not as good as the one at Manchester.  The food was served quite slow and we could see the calamari was on the kitchen table for more than 10 minutes before being served to us.  Also, we did put Birthday on my booking but nothing happened and the staff didn‚Äôt serve us the birthday plate at all, which was very disappointing and we didn‚Äôt expect this from a restaurant at this level."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Good food and even more amazing and thoughtful service from our waiter Talal who made a birthday dinner very special.
Piccolino Exchange Square,2.0,"The food was barely average, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend‚Ä¶ but the terrace is quite nice"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Ok, but not impressed. Cosy atmosphere and caring stuff. Probably perfect for a business lunch, but ¬£20 for a main is a bit of an overkill for the quality you get."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We celebrated my best friend birth and we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better atmosphere! We had the best time with delicious food, amazing Prosecco and had an excellent service from all the time! A special thank you to Alessia for taking care of us girls so well, to Luigi the general manager, Nadia, Fabio, Maurizio and the Napolitan waiter. I am looking forward to coming back here soon!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Came in for a business lunch. There was ample space, and the setting is pleasant. Staff were nice.
The menu is broad. Food was tasty. I would say that it is expensive, for what it is. Now that I read other reviews, it seems that a 50% discount is often used. This would have been great!
My main concern was regarding the service. We were simply abandoned towards the end of the meal - a dessert menu was provided, but nobody came to ask if we actually wanted dessert or coffee. I eventually wanted to pay the bill and get back to the office, but no amount of sticking my head up was enough to garner attention."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Great food, good portion size. The service was out of this world. Super Friendly, my glass was never empty!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Came here for a friends birthday and it was a lovely time. The food was great, had the calamari, rag√∫ and chocolate fondant - drinks were also lovely. The staff were extremely attentive - service was really great. Our waiter tamal was excellent as well. Would highly recommend."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,The atmosphere was absolutely fantastic. The staff were very friendly and attentive considering how busy it was in there.. Dom the manager was amazing.. Thank you for a such a wonderful evening.  Would  definitely visit Piccolino again.
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Talal was an excellent waiter and we absolutely loved the brunch. Really friendly staff!
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"I'm sorry but I was disappointed with my food at lunchtime today - the bottle of wine was lovely, the service and atmosphere were great, but the food was very lack lustre.  It was my birthday lunch, and I had salmon tagliatelle.  Well, there was very little salmon and asparagus, but nearly a whole pack of peas!  Very poor and I now have stomach ache after so many peas.  Also, the portions my friends had were very on the small side - mushroom gnocchi and beef tortelloni.  Not only that the online prices were much lower than the actual menu.   I have had far better in the locality."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"My family and I (5 of us) have started coming here every Christmas to kick off the festivities (this is the 2nd year).  This year was absolutely incredible and Dom and Talal made all of our Christmas' already with the service they provided throughout the evening.

While they had sold out of some of the items on the menu, they made sure to make up for it and went above and beyond to ensure we went away happy, from complimentary prosecco to a complimentary dessert platter to share, we left speechless and eager to go back again!  (No Karen's were made, may I point out!).

London is a big place so we considered trying a different restaurant, but it's safe to say we'll be coming back every year, come rain or shine!

Thank you again to Dom & Talal for a wonderful evening that we'll be talking about for years.

Piccolino also always listen to my notes when booking, and make sure we get a comfortable/accessible spot to accommodate my disabled partner."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We wanted to enjoy the sun on a December day and have a coffee outside. I‚Äôm glad Piccolino offers tables outside with big tents to cover the garden area, also heaters. There were no other place at the time to seat outside apart feom pubs. We didn‚Äôt have any food but service was spot on."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Very good experience.
Maurizio is the must perfect person to have to service you."
HIDE,4.0,"The food was excellent ‚Äî fresh flavors, beautifully balanced, and presented with a clean, refined aesthetic. Each dish reflected great attention to detail in execution.

Unfortunately, the service fell short of the same standard. While the plates spoke for themselves, the experience was let down when our waiter began walking away midway through explaining a dish. It disrupted the flow and diminished what should have been a polished, engaging moment.

Overall, the cooking deserves recognition, but service consistency needs to match the quality coming out of the kitchen for the experience to truly shine."
HIDE,4.0,"We celebrated an anniversary at Hide, and were lucky enough to have received a gift voucher to use for dinner. We decided on the tasting menu which was divine. The service was mostly fantastic, and we enjoyed the special experience as a whole.

We weren‚Äôt given a wine list to ascertain prices or review what we might like to drink. We were basically just asked what we like, and could‚Äôve been given ¬£¬£¬£ wines by the glass. I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with this and it felt like a fuss to ask for the menu.

The music was not a vibe and I often found it too loud. It was like classic hits and pop songs rather than an ambient, elegant restaurant playlist which I feel would be better.

The signature dessert let the entire menu down. It‚Äôs beautiful being modelled on the staircase, but the dominant banana flavour I really didn‚Äôt enjoy, and I didn‚Äôt finish it.

Overall, we did love the dinner but there were a few details that let some parts down."
HIDE,3.0,"Difficult to assess. We were told initially we were going to be upstairs, but we were sat downstairs. Very busy venue with lots of groups some quieter than others. We went for breakfast and I am a huge fan of cooked breakfasts. The ‚Äúfry up‚Äù was a very small mushroom, one unexciting sausage of no great flavour and two small rashers of streaky bacon and half a large tomato with a thick central core. The food was reasonably free of too much grease, but not overly flavoursome, sadly a nice but underwhelming breakfast, not least for the price. At ¬£30 one expects great textured flavour rich sausages. Eggs were just ages nicely cooked but not much more to say. Staff were lovely breakfast was ok. My sourdough toast was good and my daughter was thrilled with her huge croissant with a number of choices of spreads and jams. Is it interesting? Yes, was it the sort of meal I would expect to see at a one Michelin starred venue not really"
HIDE,5.0,"Went here for our anniversary dinner and had the tasting menu which was wonderful.
I wanted to especially mention our server Chloe - she was incredible. She made our evening so special and she took special care with the dietary requirements as I was pregnant. She really is a credit to this restaurant.
Chloe - if you‚Äôre reading this, you were right - we had a girl! :)"
HIDE,5.0,"‚≠êÔ∏è5 stars ‚Äì One of London‚Äôs finest, consistently exceptional.

Took my best friend here for a treat and had the tasting menu, absolutely incredible. Every dish was refined, refreshing, and packed with thoughtful flavours. It‚Äôs the kind of food you simply can‚Äôt replicate at home, which makes the experience feel special.

The portions were just right: satisfying without being overwhelming. Service was polished, friendly, and perfectly paced. You leave feeling well looked after, not overly full or rushed.

This spot has been holding the bar high for years and still delivers every single time. A true favourite. 10/10."
HIDE,5.0,"The unusual menu format drew me to Hide but I found the whole experience surpassed my expectations and was far better than the foamy fare of standard Michelin Star places. The rotation of charming service staff with each dish was a nice touch to sync in with the variety of the courses. Our favorite course was the Not A Bread but it was one of many stand outs. Ambience, design and music also all excellent. Wine pairing was mixed and didn't stand out. Would benefit from more unusual offerings complimenting the menu style."
HIDE,4.0,"It was still a wonderful dining experience but felt a little different this time due to the recent change of chef and menu. Service is good - warm and professional, and nothing is overlooked from start to end. The updated menu is quite intriguing. A couple of dishes stand out, strong getting wowed of the truffle tart. Even so, we were sad to not see some hits from the previous repeats and overall flavour profile felt a bit less bold. It is still one of the finest dinning places in the surrounding area. Eager to see how the new chef will take the culinary directions further."
HIDE,5.0,"I‚Äôll save you time- book reservations here now. Hands down the best breakfast experience I‚Äôve ever had. I especially loved the small menu of rare and fine coffees, which were all absolutely delicious with unexpected flavors. The porridge, granola, black truffle, scrambled eggs, and croque monsieur were all absolutely exceptional. To top everything off, the sleek and organic design aesthetic adds to your experience as well as the great customer service. I highly recommend and hope I can return soon!"
HIDE,3.0,"My friend and I had the tasting menu. Food was nice. The first few snacks were amazing in terms of variety and presentation, but it went downhill as we moved to the fish and lamb courses. They were still nice but not memorable, really. The restaurant was so dark at that point that we almost had to blind test our taste buds, the experience which I didn't enjoy as much. Colour vibrancy was essential to me, especially at over ¬£200 price point without alcoholic consumption. Service was lacking. The sever didn't place cutlery gently or with precision. The restaurant didn't give me a fine dining setting anyway. Explanation of the dishes was not clear, and adding on top of the lack of visual presentation in the dark, I could hardly tell which was which. The oak staircase was great. The water tank-like glass facade facing the buzz of the city was controversial at ground level though."
HIDE,5.0,"Tucked away from central London‚Äôs chaos, this must-visit spot offers a truly memorable dining experience. The serene, picturesque setting and unique aesthetics transport you far from the city the moment you arrive.

Service is top-tier; warm, thoughtful, and attentive. During a special occasion, the staff quietly offered a better table when one opened up, making the time there even more special.

The curated menu balances creativity with comfort, with each dish feeling purposeful and refined.

Perfect for celebrations or quiet escapes, this restaurant is a rare find, charming, calming, and unforgettable."
HIDE,4.0,"The service? Outstanding! The interior design? Amazing.
The food was also very good, but I have to say, the buckwheat dish (and that's the only dish I can give an opinion on) was a tad bit too acidic. Instead of raw onions, caramelised ones would give a bit of sweetness and a bit crisp, I suppose. Great quality nevertheless, and the service was amazing, very kind people. In general, more on the expensive side, but the interior design alone is worth paying a visit. Very earthy.
The tea was also very good (could be a bit stronger, though (French Blue)."
HIDE,4.0,"Service was outstanding. Immaculately presented food. The flavour profile of the dishes left me wanting, just a little bit; not quite as balanced as I would have hoped for, considering the price. Outstanding in catering for dietary requirements."
HIDE,5.0,"We booked a breakfast reservation at Hide, and it exceeded all our expectations! This one Michelin star restaurant offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but the breakfast alone is worth the visit. We were seated promptly, and the ambiance was elegant with a unique woody and quirky charm. Don‚Äôt miss the stunning spiral staircase‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect for a photo op. They offer a great selection of specialty coffees and beans; my iced coffee was excellent. The standout for me was the granola yogurt‚Äîit was absolutely fantastic. Highly recommend this spot for a refined and memorable breakfast experience!"
HIDE,5.0,"Nice breakfast experience. A bit on the pricy side but you pay for the place and location. Brioche bread on the toast and scrambled eggs a bit dry, but nothing a good spoon of butter can‚Äôt fix."
HIDE,4.0,"Nice venue, good service. My main course was a rabbit lasagna (¬£8 supplement and not really worth it as it was very small for what you get).

Americano charged at ¬£6.50 and you don‚Äôt even get a small biscuit or chocolate- a rip off for a coffee.

Compared to other restaurants, I found the venue on the overprice side  for what you get."
HIDE,5.0,Breakfast at Hide during the Pride parade - booked it via a phone call as there was no more availability for the time we wanted online - window seat to watch the parade - Magic.  Everything we ordered was seriously good.  The seasonal Danish was AMAZING. Strawberry and tonka bean - who knew?
HIDE,4.0,"I had a really nice lunch at HIDE the other day. The lunch menu is pretty well priced and comes with a starter, main, and dessert. The oyster tempura was definitely my favourite. The dessert is not as good as the mains unfortunately.

The service however could have been better - the staff were a bit cold, and it didn‚Äôt really have the attentiveness you‚Äôd expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant."
HIDE,4.0,"Had a lovely dinner at Hide, invited by a business partner. The food was creative and tasty with a very cohesive menu. The service was friendly, and our glasses were always full. The cocktail prices are quite reasonable, I'd be gladly back to have their tasting menu. Highlights for me were the amazing breads and the mushroom broth!"
HIDE,5.0,"I had an unforgettable lunch experience at Hide. From the moment I walked in, the service was impeccable ‚Äî warm, professional, and perfectly in line with Michelin standards. The lunch set menu was beautifully curated, offering refined flavors, artistic presentation, and thoughtful balance in every course. The ambiance was elegant yet relaxed, allowing me to fully enjoy each dish in comfort. Every detail, from the freshly baked bread to the final petit fours, reflected a high level of care and craftsmanship. I highly recommend Hide for anyone looking for an exceptional fine dining experience in London."
HIDE,5.0,"My first birthday celebration in London with a beautiful soul who is really thoughtful. It was a bit surprise for me as I just mentioned the name of the restaurant randomly.‚ô•Ô∏è

Thank you so much for the wonderful experience. I enjoyed the dishes we ordered and the special cards with the little candle ~ it was such a joyful moment.

I am not a wine drinker but I quite enjoyed drinking the red wine here üç∑ and it didn‚Äôt make my face red at all.

‚Ä¢ Ambiance: 5/5
‚Ä¢ Service: 5/5 ‚Äî attentive without being pushy
‚Ä¢ Food: 5/5 ‚Äî full of rich, flavorful taste
‚Ä¢ Company: 6/5

Highly recommend for a ‚≠êÔ∏è star-level dining experience or celebrating special events!"
HIDE,4.0,"Really striking restaurant- light and airy and the seating was incredibly comfortable
We were there for Sunday lunch - each course was well made and tasty - everyone enjoyed their dishes.
The stand out was the rabbit lasagne - would come back for they alone.
The desserts which are typically my favourite course were too sweet and rich with no relief or something to cut through the sugar
Would def come back to have dinner
The only let down for us was the service - unfortunately our waitress was not the nicest coming across as quite curt - asking for anything eg the drinks menu etc seemed to be a hassle for her which dampened our experience"
HIDE,4.0,"Little disappointed from this over hyped restaurant.

The setting is beautiful, the staircase is a showstopper, staff are welcoming and professional.

Attention to detail is lacking, my water glass smelled like egg (it was replaced, but should not have been at the table), sugar bowl was chipped and for a restaurant of this calibre should not have been placed at the table.

Croque monsieur was delicious but the crust was hard to cut or bite into.

The Florentine eggs were very slightly undercooked as you had the gelatinous white. The spinach was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.

For the famous banana and pecan croissant and French toast, what a disappointment.
Both lacked in taste, very soggy and uninteresting.

This was not my first nor will it be  my last time the place is beautiful, staff are lovely and I'm sure there is plenty of other dishes to try."
HIDE,5.0,"Breakfast here was such a vibe. We had the Full English, truffle scrambled eggs on toast, egg Benedict and blueberry toast. I highly recommend the blueberry toast, however the only thing that wasn‚Äôt to my taste was the Thai coffee. Being Thai myself I should‚Äôve known! Really looking forward to my next visit here."
HIDE,5.0,"Exceptional food, beautiful decor, fantastic ambience and perfect service.
Having visited a few times now I have never had a bad experience at Hide.
There is something for everyone on the menu and no dish will disappoint you, particular highlights being the softshell crab, bread basket (absolute must) and the potato cakes. All of the steaks are high quality meat cooked to perfection.
The staff are plentiful and extremely attentive but without feeling overbearing. They're always there when you need them but unlike some establishments they aren't constantly interrupting you. The sommelier team and the selection of wines behind them are the icing on the cake to the brilliant food.
From full meals, to snacks to drinks in the bar downstairs you will never be disappointed here."
HIDE,5.0,"This place was beyond my expectations. Appart from the amazing service, the food was delicious. Everything, from the bread at the start to the desert at the end was perfect. I enjoyed every moment of it. Now the place itself ‚Ä¶ simply gorgeous. The stair is actually made from one single tree. When you go there, visit the private rooms downstairs (if they are empty). Each one of them is decorated with a theme. I would recommended a hundreds times !!!"
HIDE,5.0,"The service was exceptional, the ambiance was beautiful, and the atmosphere was just perfect. The food? Absolutely unforgettable - the best breakfast I‚Äôve ever had! Whatever you do, don‚Äôt skip the soaked pistachio orange bun, it was pure perfection. Words can‚Äôt truly capture how amazing this experience was, so just go and see for yourself!"
HIDE,4.0,"We had a nice breakfast experience here overall. The free cloakroom was a nice touch as we entered. The restaurant itself is beautiful; yes, the stairs are pretty cool. The service was quite friendly and we were served fairly quickly. The croque monsieur was tasty, though the coffee was not particularly memorable, certainly not for the price."
HIDE,5.0,"Two young kids (3, 5) and a tasting menu at a Michelin star restaurant often isn‚Äôt a good idea. It was the best experience at HIDE! We were all made to feel so welcome. Phenomenal food. The ‚Äúiconic‚Äù pairing was great. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more! Thank-you HIDE for an epic, memorable experience üôè"
HIDE,5.0,"Hide was definitely one of the best restaurants I‚Äôve ever eaten at in London! This was my fifth time visiting, and I usually spend a week dining out. I‚Äôm happy to say that Hide is in my top three!

The atmosphere is fantastic, the service is excellent, and the food was absolutely on point! We also tried a vintage dessert wine, which was just perfect.

We loved it so much that we recommended it to our friends, and they loved it too!"
HIDE,3.0,"Amazing front of house team. Amazing energy and warming team. Good mushroom, black pudding and sausage. Sour dough bread was super hard, tomato needs seasoning and flavour like the mushroom. Egg where cold and so was the pate"
HIDE,5.0,I visited Hide during December and to this day I still think of it often as their interior to their food was so memorable. Starting from the beautiful open inside that spirals up a mystical feeling tree carved stair case. The Croque Madame was incredible and their Nova Lox wrap was a very creative take on meal that I have myself often at home. Service here was great and drinks were also delicious.
HIDE,5.0,Just keep coming back! Food and Service outstanding and not to mention the wine list. Especially Sanita went above and beyond to share the secrets of the staircase. Will definitely be booking to come back soon.
HIDE,5.0,"Hide is just fantastic! The atmosphere is great and it is just a very good place to enjoy high quality food! From the pastries, to the sweets and savory tu dishes! Really enjoyed the experience!"
HIDE,5.0,Great spot for brunch for a special occasion - they gave me a card and a candle on my pastry for my birthday. Loved the truffle scramble eggs on toast and we also had the buckwheat pancake waffle with smoked salmon (less memorable). The pain au chocolate was also lovely though and the staff were super attentive and willing to go the extra mile to take photos for us. Coffee was also great and good selection of beans.
HIDE,5.0,Fantastic breakfast. The fresh sweet mango is prepared particularly special. We also had the avocado and poached eggs and fresh juices. The centre piece of the restaurant is the spiral hand carved staircase and the front door is also amazing in that it‚Äôs almost ‚Äúhidden‚Äù
HIDE,4.0,"We visited for breakfast, the pastries and croque Madame were really good. Unfortunately found the brioche for the truffle scrambled egg quite dry.
Service was great and was nice atmosphere."
HIDE,4.0,"Celebrated my birthday here last week. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. We got the bread basket (highly recommend), the nest egg (10/10), beetroot starter (7/10), scallops (8/10), mains were venison (7/10) and octopus (8/10), with a pear sorbet (9/10).

It was a great experience and the service was excellent! The decor is beautiful as well, we will be back to experience the breakfast:)"
HIDE,4.0,"I‚Äôve been here twice for breakfast/brunch. I wouldn‚Äôt say the food is amazing, but it‚Äôs really, really good. It‚Äôs a little pricey, but since it‚Äôs a fancy place, that‚Äôs expected. The ambiance is super stylish‚ÄîI especially like their area on the upper floor. My a√ßa√≠ bowl was just okay, but the matcha was really good, and the pastries were excellent."
HIDE,5.0,"Great meal out last night in the UK.  Order two bread baskets, one goes quick.  Food and service were outstanding.  Great night out."
HIDE,5.0,Been here twice for brunch. Once solo and one with friends for my birthday. Each time I received impeccable friendly service. The breakfast and pastries were both divine. Such a pretty restaurant too.
HIDE,1.0,"Lovely restaurant, swift service and great presentation. The price you pay, the portions you receive not worth it at all. Food was very average at best. Menu description was great and really oversold very average food.

Was not impressed with the way they portrayed the choice of waiters/waitresses for food service. They had chosen a few certain ethnic backgrounds which isn't an issue but the way they were serving was as if they had been told to act a certain way. Reminded me of slaves. Really not impressed."
HIDE,5.0,Great food. Egg royale is very recommended. The service was great and waited maximum 5 minutes until I got my order. Should note that the prices are high.
HIDE,5.0,"Loved the meal here! Serves were knowledgable, super friendly and they gave us a tour of the wine cellar too! Great evening out"
HIDE,4.0,"What a lovely experience.
We got a table that overlooked Green Park which was a lovely sight.
The food was good, perhaps slightly underwhelming for a one star restaurant.
Service was on point, the sommelier was very friendly and knowledgeable.
We didn‚Äôt feel rushed and enjoy every single minute of our experience.
For a treat, go and try Hide. You overall won‚Äôt be disappointed"
HIDE,1.0,"This restaurant has been our favourite for years, we always recommended it to friends and visitors. But the last visit was a waste of money, sadly. We couldn‚Äôt understand the change but later learnt that Ollie is no longer the chef there üíî he would have never put raw unseasoned cucumbers at the top like that. Smaller portions and thin flavour. I understand the loyalty to promote your other staff but won‚Äôt be surprised if you lose your star next year. The desserts were great but it‚Äôs just one course from 4 we tried. Gutted to lose this place ü•∫"
HIDE,5.0,"Is the staircase amazing? Yes
Is the service good? Yes
Is the food excellent? Yes
Is the view nice? Yes

But, I've had better pastries elsewhere in London for way cheaper (it cost me ¬£72 for 2 drinks and 3 dishes of food.)

It's definitely an experience and somewhere to have a celebration, but I don't think we'd ever come back on a whim."
HIDE,5.0,"Had an intimate wedding dinner in a private room (reading room). Thoughtful and whimsical decor. The staff was exceptional! Not only in knowledge of what they were doing, also very personal and authentic. THATS what you need in a great service team! Food was excellent as well, as expected from a Michelin Restaurant, but the service was what makes you feel at home. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è"
HIDE,5.0,"Very happy with the set lunch (though still pricey, nett ¬£64).
Lamb tartare starter - excellent, prata bread and greens complemented perfectly.
Steamed cod - excellent, flavourful mussel broth, perfectly cooked fish to the ideal texture, and a satisfying portion size
Lava tart and oak ice cream - average. Ice cream was quite melted (maybe the bowl wasn‚Äôt pre-chilled)"
HIDE,4.0,"We have lovely breakfast.  We like it esp the French Toast.
Both decoration and ambience is very nice."
HIDE,5.0,"One of my favourite restaurants in London. I‚Äôve been at least 8 times and the breakfast and lunch are both equally amazing, alongside the service and ambience. The bar downstairs is also great with wonderful negronis. The bread basket is the best bread basket I‚Äôve ever had."
HIDE,3.0,"Food was outstanding, but our service and experience was disappointing. I think we got unlucky with our waiter, we were left waiting 30 minutes to order our food and he got my main order wrong. He was very uncommunicative and didn‚Äôt double check our order at all. We were visiting for breakfast and got very hungry. I noticed people around us had a stall for their bags, but we weren‚Äôt given this. I was expecting a lot better from a Michelin star restaurant. We were visiting for a special occasion (anniversary) and did not feel like it was as much of a treat as it should have been."
HIDE,4.0,"Our first time here, ordered croque madame with truffle. It was pretty nice. Enjoyed much."
HIDE,5.0,Lovely restaurant with pleasant staff. Price commentate to location and decor. Food was good.
HIDE,1.0,"I was genuinely excited to have breakfast at HIDE, but left disappointed. I ordered the ‚ÄúRipe honey mango with Thai basil & kaffir lime‚Äù the description sounded refined and thoughtful. In reality, it was just two plain mango slices with a few micro herbs on top. No noticeable kaffir lime, no complexity, no special touch. Just mango. It felt more like a garnish than a standalone dish

Also, many dishes are not available for takeaway ‚Äúdue to sauces or presentation,‚Äù which makes it unnecessarily restrictive especially when the food is quite simple

A beautiful place, but the experience didn‚Äôt live up to expectations"
HIDE,3.0,"Style over substance. The bread is it's high and it goes down from there. Had the tasting menu which is hors d'oeuvre 3 courses and petit fours. For ¬£165 not good value! The food whilst cooked well was unimaginative and I wasn't wowed by the flavour. The lamb dish was a toughish piece of meat and the fat not rendered down.

Any easy pass"
HIDE,3.0,"I had high expectations for the food considering the Michelin star and the rave reviews online by influencers. Unfortunately, I thought that the food was lacklustre considering the price point and what the restaurant sets out to achieve.

Firstly, the French toast was decent but not amazing. The insides were more mushy than soft, hence there was a lack of bite to the dish.

Secondly, the croissants I ordered - chocolate and pecan banana were served cold, and I think they would have tasted better if they were warm. There was hardly any chocolate in the chocolate croissant at all.

Oysters were okay if on the small side.

Service was decent but restaurant was really busy on the day I went so staff was unable to interact much with guests.

Overall, would expect better for the price point of the restaurant."
HIDE,4.0,"Was there a few weeks ago to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday, and it was a great dining experience. The service was attentive, friendly, and thoughtful, making the occasion feel extra special.

The food was was beautifully presented. Some of the dishes that I enjoyed were so unique as well like the scallops specifically. The restraunt‚Äôs ambiance made this a memorable experience."
HIDE,5.0,"Staff were friendly and attentive, food and drinks were effortless, quick to arrive and very tasty for breakfast. The speciality coffee was amazing, have never tasted such a smooth coffee in my life. Price point was fair for quality and service. Can‚Äôt wait to come back, maybe for dinner next time."
HIDE,5.0,Fine dining done right! The food was great overall but the buckwheat pancake with salmon and cream cheese was the star of the show üåü
HIDE,4.0,"Great experience all round. Good food, excellent service and relaxed but still nice environment.
Stand-out menu item was the French toast. The banana pecan croissant was not everything it was hyped to be. Everything else was great."
HIDE,5.0,"It was an amazing celebration of my birthday in such a beautiful, cozy atmosphere of the highest quality restaurant in the heart of central London. Thank you so much for that evening üòä.  Everything was perfect üëå."
HIDE,5.0,We had an amazing anniversary dinner. Special mention to our server SINITA not sure of the spelling. But she really did a great job explaining the dishes to us. Our favorite is the carabineros prawns it was superb highly recommended. ü•∞
HIDE,4.0,"During my recent visit to The Hide, I found the food to be decent but not particularly remarkable. Among the dishes we tried, the egg nest and grilled octopus stood out as the better options, showcasing some creativity and flavor. However, the overall dining experience was marred by service issues.

It was a busy night at the restaurant, which undoubtedly contributed to the challenges we faced in getting attention from our server. We often found ourselves needing to flag down someone just to refill our water or wine glasses, which is frustrating during a celebratory girls' night out in London.

When our main courses arrived, there was a notable mix-up with the orders. The server seemed confused about which dish belonged to whom, which is quite unacceptable, especially in a busy restaurant setting. This added a layer of stress to the evening that detracted from our enjoyment.

Ultimately, the lack of timely refills for our drinks significantly impacted our experience. It‚Äôs disappointing when a night out is overshadowed by service shortcomings, despite the potential for a good meal. I hope The Hide can address these issues, as the food has promise, but the service needs improvement to match."
HIDE,5.0,"Visited HIDE for breakfast and I would say it has to be one of the most opulent breakfast experiences I've had!

The venue is truly stunning and ascending the iconic staircase to my table really set the scene for the experience.

I ordered the Full English with poached eggs and a Flat White. Both were excellent, every element of the breakfast plate was meticulously prepared and presented. The bread and butter were incredibly good and the eggs were poached to perfection. The coffee was also excellent, I chose an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee however there are a variety of coffees to choose from.

Service was relaxed and attentive without being overbearing.

It's not every day one gets the chance to have a Michelin-starred breakfast. It's a very enjoyable experience and one I would recommend!"
HIDE,2.0,"Ngl I feel like Ive just been scammed. Ridiculous price for such a bad experience, the starter was the first but not the last disappointment, I was expected to experience the journey of Italian cuisine, not an Asian parent‚Äôs simulator, the starter what was the name? Meat n Bones? Just a small piece of bacon wrapped around a bone like stick no taste no flavor just purely for show. It‚Äôs like you(an Asian) were presented with your firstborn child and you don‚Äôt know what to do with the child so you tried to give the kid every chances in life only for it to end up as a mixture of fancy useless failure. The rest of the dishes were the same as the first, bunches of f disappointment. The attitude of one of the waitress was not very polite, we were talking when the waitresses bring out the dishes and started coughing or something, trying to stop us from talking so she can introduce the dish(it happened many times not just once), very unprofessional, is what normal people would say but for me, she is a spoiled brat who were definitely raised by a bad single parent(clearly she did not know how to behave in such environment) because what she was doing not only damaged her reputation but the restaurant too, she must know that actions have consequences, I normally would leave a 15% tips but for her action I regret that I can not take the tips from her. (personally Im asian and where Im from, attitudes, especially in the service‚Äôs industry is everything, the key to success or their downfall). Last but not least, the atmosphere was in fact the most pleasant thing out of everything I had just mentioned above. The wooden stair was alright but still nothing impressive like Bacchanalia. For conclusion, save your money for other high-end restaurants, this one does not worth the hype nor the price. I only choose to go to this one on valentine because others are fully booked. Just for the final nail in the coffin, anyone know the differences between jokes and food from HIDE? Jokes have meanings. I am being generous to give it a 2 stars rating, it deserves 0,5."
HIDE,4.0,"Visited HIDE before Christmas for lunch.

Overall we found this place lived upto our expectations, with great front of house staff, lovely atmosphere and stunning surroundings.

The food was expectational but even for regulars to Michelin star restaurants, we found it very expensive."
HIDE,1.0,"Very bland fish with two pieces of a vegetable, 3 mussels and of course a foamy sauce. Pretty tasteless, not worth the hype. The waiter kept coming to talk to us which was irritating, called us ""his lovely ladies"" üôÑ Also we took tap water but they put still water on our bill and almost charged us."
HIDE,5.0,"From the moment I walked in, the space felt elegant but still super inviting, with all the natural light coming through those huge glass windows. Walking up the iconic staircase to my table really set the vibe for something special. The service was on point; really friendly and attentive but not over the top. For the quality of food and the whole experience, I‚Äôd say it was well worth it. If you‚Äôre looking for a fancy but relaxed breakfast spot in London, this is it. Whether you‚Äôre into Michelin-starred dining or just want to treat yourself, I‚Äôd definitely recommend giving it a try!"
HIDE,5.0,"To me, one of the best restaurants in London for all occasions. Service is exceptional. Ambience, food servicing, selection of spirits, it all gives you a unique experience.
My personal top choice is breakfast for sure, definitely go for French toast, and try any pastry (these are freshly baked every morning)
Dinner is also worth mentioning. Every dish is a masterpiece. From starters, I really enjoyed scallops and mackerel tartar.
As for the main, my go-to is octopus (it just melts)"
HIDE,4.0,"Service and location make this place worth a visit.  Sit on the 1st floor with a view of Green Park.    The Mango dish was yummy, but very small.    Croque Monsieur hit the mark."
HIDE,5.0,"Hands down best breakfast place in London. Obsessed with their food. Come here every couple of weeks to check out new pastries on the menu- always innovative! It is pricey, but as expected in Mayfair. Service not always on point (they seem to have a lot of rotation), but that‚Äôs just a detail and the food is worth it! Nice coffee selection with some interesting choices. Try it!"
HIDE,5.0,"One of the best dining experiences I've had, not just in London, but in all of the places I've ever travelled to. I was down with work and brought along my partner - and we both LOVED the food and hospitality was next level. Can't recommend this place enough to anyone that loves dining at the next level."
HIDE,5.0,"I unfortunately was not looking at the menu prices properly or it's just I didn't think that my starter which I chose XL size prawns wouldn't cost me a 90¬£ , but I was wrong and I actually didn't really enjoy them as of I payed 90¬£ ,but didn't had any satisfaction from having it. Glad it isn't me the one who payed our bill :)))"
HIDE,5.0,"This was our first time in a Michelin starred restaurant, and thus at HIDE. Everything was perfect, from service to food. Everyone was very welcoming, waiters gave us awesome food recommendations! For the quality of the food we tasted, this felt perfectly priced. This is hands on the best restaurant I‚Äôve been to.
I‚Äôd recommend trying the chicken liver parfait, and the chocolate pot, both were wow."
HIDE,5.0,"It was an amazing evening at HIDE. The team was so hospitable and delivered from the moment we stepped into the restaurant till the end.

From introducing the menu to giving recommendations, we were easily convinced by the knowledgeable staff.

Food in general was really presentable, we were a little underwhelmed by the highly acclaimed appetiser - nest egg. It was solid but it didn‚Äôt deliver the wow factor we were expecting. However, the meticulous craftsmanship dedicated to creating the dish and the egg itself was appreciated.

The mains were just gorgeous, we ordered chicken, pork and squid. They were all very delicious and cooked to perfection, we didn‚Äôt leave anything behind. We also really loved how the meat dishes were prepared in more than one ways, so you can get variations out of the dishes. It was a lovely bonus! We order some sides and they were all solid.

The highlight of the evening had got to be the acorn cake, we ordered one each and we all thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of the searing and bubbling cake, which was a well made brioche soaked in syrup, caramel and alcohol. It was dense, but it was divine.

The only hiccup that evening was the server of our table had been mixing up the sparkling and still water preferences for guests, at one point he even mixed different water into our glasses."

Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Came here for a birthday dinner with my partner, and the experience was truly exceptional!

The food was absolutely delicious, where the calf brain stood out as an especially memorable dish. The snails, lamb, and pheasant were all super delicious.

On top of that, the serving was absolutely excellent, where the waiter was incredibly helpful, friendly, and nice.

It was such an enjoyable experience that we booked in our next visit for my birthday dinner before we left.

Very highly recommend place, and I would argue it is the best place to eat in the area!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Had a wonderful experience at this restaurant!
Everything was delicious ‚Äî each dish was prepared with great care and full of flavour.
The atmosphere was top-notch ‚Äî cozy, stylish, and very welcoming.
Service was excellent ‚Äî friendly and attentive staff.
I really enjoyed it! üí´"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Love it, love it! Amazing food, impeccable service, great prices and lovely atmosphere. Though I live a little far away from their location, I will certainly frequent it and endure the longer-than-usual car ride.
Though I paid over ¬£100 per person, I ordered a large amount of food so that I try the tastefully curated menu.  Dave, the co-owner was most hospitable and made the night speciall"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Beautiful, authentic French food in a cosy setting (only 40 seats) with great personal service: there‚Äôs a reason why Bouchon Racine is a secret favourite for many and why tables are booked months in advance. The menu changes daily based on seasonality, but always delivers outstanding unpretentious quality. Highly recommended"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The best French bistro u can find in London.  I don‚Äôt generally go to the same restaurants again but this place is the place I would love to go every time!! The AMAZING food(the authentic French cuisine with quality), cozy environment, friendly but very professional staff.. I cannot recommend it more!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,This was an outstanding experience! This Bistro is over a 300 year old pub. The recipes are from Chef's French Grandmother. Everything was delicious! The duck market was devine-one of the best I've ever eaten. Chef tops it off with a sprinkle of breaded escargot--to absolutely die for--WOW-WOW--WOW!! The desert was also orgasmic. Service was lovely. And atmosphere delightful in the atrium. Will recommend to everyone who comes to London. Thank you!
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Fabulous.  We had an early table (6pm) on Wednesday evening.  The place was buzzing with a great atmosphere.   Service was second to none with staff being incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.  The food was outstanding.   We had girolles on toast and sarfette de banon (goat's cheese), figs and olive oil to start followed by rabbit, smoked bacon and mustard sauce and tete de veau with sauce ravigote. We also had sides of fries and creamed spinach with foie grass.   We finished with a petit pot au chocolate and a creme caramel with prune in armagnac. Highly recommended."
Bouchon Racine,4.0,"Delicious French restaurant in London. We loved the orzo (incredible), the rabbit and steak au poivre as well as the creme caramel and almond/berry tart. Some of the appetizers like the steak tartare, chicken liver pate and the zucchini salad were okay. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great French bistro."
Bouchon Racine,1.0,"One of the worst French restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to, the brill steak which costs ¬£42 tasted blend and literally only the fish and sauce on its own, the creamed spinach didn‚Äôt taste anything not even spinach and the pork was the only one which tasted ok, the baguette tasted like a baguette and chips tasted like average chips, Americano was awful. I saw the buying reviews stuff before came to the restaurant feeling bit unsure, it was packed in a Sat lunch, they did not approach to get a 5 star review. I have to say it‚Äôs one of the most not worth the price place to go‚Ä¶"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The most fantastic food and service
Phenomenal French food - the danger is you want it all! Great wine menu too the pub downstairs is fab as well and the lunches cooked by the same chefs are brilliant too. Hands down one of best places in London at the moment. üëåüèª"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Incredible experience. Shared the Herring starter, nice little taster. Then we dived into the Cote D'Boeuf, sensational taste and a massive portion for 2 people. Followed by a chocolate ganache which was rich and delicious. Everything was spot on, the serving staff, the food and the ambience."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Just had an incredible lunch at Bouchon Racine with friends! Despite not being familiar with all the French dishes, our server was fantastic, so thorough in explaining everything and offering great recommendations.

We started with the mangalitza ham and bread, which was absolutely divine. (Heads up, it's a fattier cut, so if you prefer leaner, keep that in mind!) For starters, the asparagus, morels, mangalitza, and comt√© dish was truly stunning, served in a rich butter sauce.
Our main, the sharing pork chop and sausage with a rich lentil base and tarragon/horseradish sauce, was outstanding.

I've been wanting to try Bouchon Racine for ages, and it completely lived up to expectations. Highly recommend ‚Äì can't wait to go back!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Honestly better to some of the bistros I went to in Paris! We arrived and were given a lovely table in their alcove, which had lots of good natural lighting and a lovely atmosphere.

We ordered the Steak Tartare, Goat Cheese Salad with Courgettes, and Bayonne Ham with Celeriac Remoulade to start, and the absolute star was the Steak Tartare. One of the best we‚Äôve had in recent memory. The sourdough rye was also a lovely accompaniment to it. The goat cheese salad was also very good, and I found the bayonne ham wonderful but the celeriac remoulade was very sharp and not to my taste.

For mains, we shared the Rabbit, Filet Au Poivre, and the Orzo. The Orzo was INCREDIBLE, and we also very much enjoyed the steak and rabbit. But something about the Orzo will have me thinking about it for days - what a dish!

We then had the creme caramel and colonel sorbet for desserts - one was sweet and the other more refreshingly sour, so we had a good balance to end the night.

We will definitely return!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"I love this place. It‚Äôs so timeless and charming and never gets old. Their changing menu means you can try something different every time. Steak au Poivre is a staple they do so well, with a side of their chunky frites and the most wonderful creamed spinach! Which was one of the reasons I went a second time. For dessert, the Creme Caramel and Pot au Chocolat are not to be missed. A rewarding experience for the struggle of getting a table."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Absolutely outstanding experience at Bouchon Racine! Service was great and warm, making us feel instantly welcome (even though we were the last ones there, they never rushed us out)
The place has charming vibe, perfect for enjoying a great meal.
And the food‚Ä¶ wow! From the oysters to the veal with Roquefort butter, everything was perfect. Even the fries were on another level! Also, the wine list is on top
I‚Äôll definitely be coming back, it's an unforgettable spot!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"My friend and I had a fantastic evening.

We were blown away by the chicken p√¢t√© ‚Äì it was seriously one of the best things I've ever tasted. The rabbit was also cooked to perfection.

The service was top-notch, the atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and the food was absolutely incredible.

I can't recommend this place enough!"""
Bouchon Racine,5.0,A menu full of excellent sounding dishes. Everything is perfectly prepared and delicious. Service is friendly and efficient. There is really nothing to fault here
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"New favourite French restaurant in London. The food was divine and the service very friendly and attentive. We had the chicken liver pat√© and endive salad as entree, and the rabbit in mustard sauce and bavette steak as mains.

Reasonably priced for a restaurant of such high quality! Highly recommended"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Exceptional. Top quality cooking. The beef tartare is incredible, wish I'd ordered the bigger portion. Rabbit perfectly cooked, with a well judged mustard sauce. The creme caramel is an absolute joy, could've eaten two. I ate on the balcony terrace, which is super cosy. The service was perfect, attentive but unfussy. Well considered wine list, sensible pricing and a good by the glass choice. Great value imho, considering the quality of the cooking and all-round experience. Looking forward to going back!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Cracking lunch - the roast chicken for two was massive and very very very succulent with a top notch sauce. Chicken liver pate hummed with smooth earthiness. Cr√®me caramel was bordering on ecstatic in its depths. Great friendly service too.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Love it, love it! Amazing food, impeccable service, great prices and lovely atmosphere. Though I live a little far away from their location, I will certainly frequent it and endure the longer-than-usual car ride.
Though I paid over ¬£70 per person, I ordered a large amount of food so that I try the tastefully curated menu. l went with my friends and we really enjoyed their food, service was top notch and great atmosphere.

Bouchon Racine,5.0,"An authentic bistro. There aren‚Äôt many French restaurant in London, so I‚Äôm grateful. Make sure to try the pudding for the desert. I‚Äôll definitely go there again!
And good for me, dogs friendly!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"You don‚Äôt get voted the best restaurant in the UK for nothing. Simply mind blowing. The service was some of the best with knowledgeable waiters who took time to make sure we ordered correctly. Food and wine are just some of the best you‚Äôll get to enjoy. Standouts were the oysters, snails, veal chop and the duck but dare I say I don‚Äôt think you could go wrong ordering anything from the menu. Sheer indulgence at its finest"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"I recommend Bouchon Racine if you are visiting a restaurant with high standards especially, taking friends and families. Their staff has a good attitude and their services are satisfying. The experience here is unimaginable and worth spending on their delicious meals."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The food is exceptional here and along with the service makes it one of the top restaurants in London for French cuisine. Both of my visits were great, loved the rabbit and the veal as well as the pork chop. Would highly recommend for a special occasion and not spend a fortune ( estimate ¬£100/person with a couple of drinks)"
Bouchon Racine,3.0,"The food was decent in general. I found it difficult to appreciate Tete de Veau as it was flavorless, quite fatty, and had very strange skin texture. The desserts were very good. I didn‚Äôt like the fact the restaurant cheekily added 1 pound charity donation to the bill without saying anything."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Tuck my mum out for lunch for her birthday she enjoyed it. Staff was amazing and was warm a friendly as soon as you walked in made you feel like you was a long time customer. I would definitely go again for that quality food at them prices I'll be going for full works and dragging my mum me for who evers birthday it is.

Chef also came out with a bottle of wine for her and a rose best chef ever"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,We had such a lovely experience at Bouchon Racine. The meal recommendations were exceptional and service was attentive! Thank you for a memorable meal.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Totally lived up to my expectation if not better!! Everything was delicious - the best end veal with the morels sauce was the highlight of the night. The meat was so tender and juicy, paired perfectly with the creamy sauce. Staff service was excellent we were unfortunately late due to the breakdown of the tube but the staff made sure that we were not rushed and enjoyed every single dish."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Wow! Has been my favorite restaurant in London for a long time. I think it was the sixth visit today and for the first time the food was not ten out of ten. However, the service and the way issues were impeccably dealt with, especially by Tilly has meant Bouchon Racine stays top of my go to and recommended list. Genuinely taken aback by how kind, reasonable and understanding they were when it wasn‚Äôt the usual impeccable standard ( shout out Tilly- she deserves a raise, because I‚Äôm sure I can be difficult!!) I‚Äôll be back as soon as I can get a reservation!"
Bouchon Racine,4.0,"Excellent French cuisine.
We‚Äôve order a decent amount for two people. Everything was accurate and delicious. Full of butter felt like an uplifted hidden bistro. The only dish we did not like was the famous eel salad. French fries were surprisingly moshie from the inside but super crispy on the outside. Orzo was also phenomenal and probably one of the best ones I‚Äôve ever had.
Desserts were light. I would avoid the Mont Blanc which was boring."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Haven‚Äôt had any luck with the reservation system but friend got a table so happily joined. It certainly did not disappoint although my stomach sometimes disagrees with the heaviness of French cuisine. It‚Äôs partially fault of our own as we almost ordered all the desert on offer - all are exceptionally good, in particular the Mont Blanc which has won my desert of the year award. The yellow chicken was also divine."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Great food and not too expensive. Enjoyed the experts behind the bar and the chefs were really talkative too.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"This restaurant offers a unique experience with its two-part setup. While the pub on the ground floor may not be visually appealing, the dining area on the upper floor transports you to a charming French ambiance. The highlight is the beautifully designed balcony with a glass ceiling, truly a marvel in London. Overall, the menu provides a fantastic variety. The signature chicken liver pate didn't suit my personal taste; the veal head, despite some traces of fur, and the surprising veal tongue were enjoyable. The expertly cooked rabbit leg surpassed some one-Michelin star establishments.This is a restaurant for true food lover. The value offered is commendable. However, it's worth noting that the national restaurant award's comment may have slightly exaggerated the food."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"My best experience in London! The food was beyond expectation. Everyone in service very nice and attentive. It was great overall. Booking a table is very hard, but don‚Äôt lose hope. If you call the restaurant they might help you for later months. The food is typical to Lyonnaise cuisine and delicious. I tried the veal (seasonal main), beef tartare, cheese and salad and 2 different puddings. I thought the meal was already the best, but believe me you haven‚Äôt had crem caramel before. It can‚Äôt be this good!! Looking forward to my next visit."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Came here for my birthday, the staff is lovely and kind and even gave me a drink on the house. The food was outstanding, some of the best meals ive tasted. And it was a beautiful calm aesthetic inside. 100% recommended coming here, definitely deserving of 5 stars and arguably more."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Really hard to book this restaurant but actually just need to give them a call in the morning. It's always full. Dinner time either 6pm or 8pm. I love the handwritten menu and I really like the rabbit in mustard sauce.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Was there on Thursday. Make a reservation from Singapore 1 week before I landed. Best to call them directly.

Love their food. It's more towards French Traditional cooking which you cannot find in Singapore.

A must try. Their menu is writing on a chalkboard so it changes from time to time.

Total damage was ¬£130+ for 2 appetizers, 2 mains, 2 glasses of wine, 1 btl of mineral water and a dessert.

I will said for the price and food type I will go back again and in Singapore you will never get to try these kind of food without burning a hole in your wallet"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Excellent meal and worth the wait. Can't fault the food, service, or bustling dining room. Absolutely loved the rabbit, pork salad, and the creme caramel with armagnac prune. Already booked a return visit!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Fantastic food and fantastic atmosphere. Came here for a birthday lunch and had a great time!!!
Bouchon Racine,4.0,"Lovely intimate restaurant with fantastic artworks and ambient lighting. Our waiters were very friendly and knowledge on all fronts from the food to the wine. The menu is truly authentic French cuisine, there is a dish to please all tastes but very meat focused. We thought the escargots were amazing! The white sausage was slightly too soft a texture and had an overly processed look about it. The rabbit was amazing with the haricot vert and mustard sauce, as were the fries. However the bavette was slightly chewy, so about 50/50 on very good to average."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"""I kept walking past it thinking 'no, that can't be it, that's a pub...'""

Once the final member of our dining party had pushed through the confusion to climb the stairs up to Bouchon Racine, we had the most spectacular sharing-style French meal seated around a round table in the middle of the restaurant, with the unmistakable buzz of ""London pints on a warm summer's day"" rising from the street below.

Every starter was a hit, but the Coombeshead Farm Mangalitza (platter of cured pork meat) and chicken liver pate accompanied by the most beautiful bread I can remember tasting were highlights.

For mains we opted for a series of sharing dishes, from cote de boeuf to assiette du Bouchon (a kind of platter of chicken and pork on lentils) to the 'best end' of lamb. A superb meat feast.

Finally, a taste of several desserts finished the meal brilliantly (though I could easily have eaten the apricot and almond tart all by myself).

Wonderful experience, and all the buzz is well deserved."
Bouchon Racine,3.0,Not very in line with my pallet of taste. The desserts were very enjoyable.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Finally got to try Bouchon Racine and can certainly understand why it is always booked out! Menu is quite big on meats. We tried all the classic dishes, and everything was brilliantly seasoned. Loved the creamed spinach with foie gras and wish we had more fries or bread to finish it up. But the cr√®me caramel was definitely a showstopper. Would have gotten seconds, it is the best cr√®me caramel we‚Äôve ever had. Service was warm and friendly, staff were all very welcoming and ready to give honest recommendations if you ask!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Fantastic food. Brilliant service. Cr√®me caramel is the best we‚Äôve tasted. Bravo!
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Bouchon Racine is a hidden gem that transports you straight to Paris. Every dish is beautifully executed ‚Äî the duck confit was melt-in-the-mouth perfection, and the wine list is superb. The intimate, relaxed atmosphere and genuinely warm service made the whole evening unforgettable. A true French delight in the heart of London. Five stars, without question."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Yes, I concur that Bouchon Racine is amazing! :) Delicious and delightful food.. the lovely setting eggs you onto having a most leisurely lunch. Enjoyed the bavette with sauce verte (although still reminisce about the veal chop from a previous visit). The Cr√®me Caramel is a showstopper!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Bouchon Racine is an absolute gem. From the moment you step inside, you're met with impeccable service that strikes the perfect balance between warmth and professionalism. The attention to detail is evident in every interaction, making the dining experience truly special.

Now, let's talk about the steak tartare‚Äînothing short of perfection. Fresh, expertly seasoned, and beautifully presented, it's a dish that lingers in your mind long after the last bite. The flavors are refined yet bold, showcasing the kitchen‚Äôs mastery.

Whether you're a devoted foodie or simply looking for a top-tier dining experience, Bouchon Racine is a must-visit. Highly recommended!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Got the first lunch table, which turned out well as it got quite busy! Food and service amazing. Had the oysters, a side of baguette slices, and the sharing rib-eye. Decent wine by the glass options"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"From the moment we arrived, the service was superbly professional without being stuffy. Our server described the blackboard menu with confidence and charm ‚Äî no pretension, just genuine enthusiasm for the food  . The front‚Äëof‚Äëhouse team earned high praise across the board: ‚ÄúFront of house 10/10‚Äù and ‚Äúgood honest service‚Ä¶"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"overall: authentic french bistro with every single dish to die for. great atmosphere for date night, fancy dinner or simply there to enjoy the food.

steak tartare üêÑ: a classic staple executed perfectly, served with warm crispy sourdough.

rabbit üêá: haven‚Äôt tried enough rabbit dishes to comment on the meat, but it has the same tenderness of chicken thighs. really enjoyed how the mustard sauce adds a mellow warmth.

bavette ü•©: perfectly cooked steak, still pink inside. salsa cuts through the greasiness of steak.

duck breast ü¶Ü: slightly chewy cut of meat (in a good way) with a strong gamey flavour.  love all the side veggies & THE SAUCE (love that they serve extra sauce on the side)

creamed spinach ü•¨: you can taste the umami from the foie gras. tho the texture can be a less creamy, as it was almost soup-like

cr√®me caramel üçÆ: simple but delicious

pot de cr√®me üç®: it‚Äôs not too sweet, which i love."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Up an unassuming staircase in a Farringdon pub lies London‚Äôs hottest new French restaurant. Getting a reservation was hard work, but it really paid off. The food and service in the small and cosy bistro is really good. Nice steak tartare, but the rabbit with bacon and mustard sauce was the showstopper. Good chips too. Dessert was probably the least impressive part of the meal, but the other courses made up for it. Service was excellent, and the staff were very friendly and helpful in choosing wines, refilling glasses and so on.
As a constructive feedback, I would like to see more wines on sale by the glass. They had only 4 reds and 5 whites by the glass.

Hope to be back soon."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"On Saturday afternoon, we tried our luck for lunch at a popular French restaurant in London. The uber driver couldn‚Äôt drop us off in front of the restaurant because of construction so we walked the rest of the way. There were hundreds of people shouting and what seemed like a protest in the same direction we were headed. But, as we got closer to the big crowd, we realised it was a tailgate party in front of a pub for the fans of the Luton Football club. They were really loud and cheering pridefully for their team prior to the game. It was a big game as a win would move them to the Premier League next season.

So we finally made our way into restaurant on the second level. Bouchon Racine was opened last October but they had a cult following for the chef. We were met at the front door by Dave. We told him we didn‚Äôt have a reservation and that we came a long way to try the food. The restaurant has a few empty tables waiting for the guests to arrive and Dave was doing his best to see if there were any no shows or cancellations but people were still making their way to the restaurant. Desperately hoping for some sort of miracle, Dave suddenly had an idea. He rushed out to the stairs area and quickly came back with a small table and two chairs. He found a corner to place the intimate table and we were set!

Dave brought over a chalkboard with a full hand written menu, he went over each item from the starters to desserts with extreme detail. We decide on the Tomato French bean anchovies salad and Chicken liver pate to start. It went so well with the red wine Peter, our server, recommended us.
For the mains, we went with the John dory mousserons leeks noir de bigorre ham and the Lamb chops wilted escarole rosemary garlic piment. The lamb dish reminded us of the mutton chops at the famous Keens Steakhouse in NYC. It was absolutely devine. Of course we had to have the Creme caramel armagnac prune for dessert, it was so creamy. üòã‚ù§Ô∏è A French meal would not be completed without a coffee and a glass of Armagnac.

Everything was so good, that we couldn't help but to look again and again at the chalkboard menu, thinking of what we could have tried. Haha üòÅüòÅüòÅ Thank you Dave and Peter for your genuine hospitality. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"We had a fantastic weekend lunch here. The food was fantastic, can‚Äôt wait to go back and try more. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Had really good time. Highly recommend."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Wonderful ‚ÄòGoldilocks‚Äô brasserie - it‚Äôs not too big, not too small; not too expensive but really not cheap; relaxed pace but good service‚Ä¶ The menu however is no compromise - excellent ingredients, taste-first cooking with charming presentation and lick-the-plate finish.
It‚Äôs non-showy. You can have a date or business lunch there and focus on your guest without the food piling you in the eye. It does however infuse a certain chuckle of joy and anticipation to proceedings and it‚Äôs memory may outlive the business or the relationship ;)
Sadly it‚Äôs now so (deservedly) popular that bookings are like hen‚Äôs teeth and so a long or lucky game needs to be played. It‚Äôs worth it though. Just go."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Bouchon Racine is a cozy neighborhood gem tucked above a pub, offering an intimate candlelit dining experience full of charm. The chalkboard menu showcases fresh, seasonal produce, and the wine list is both carefully curated and reasonably priced. The service is attentive and warm, adding to the overall inviting atmosphere. Though tables can be hard to come by, the effort is absolutely worthwhile for such a delightful dining experience. Highly recommended!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Have had a reservation booked for a few weeks to treat myself and my partner to a nice good meal. Having read reviews, we were buzzing to see what the fuss was about and we were not disappointed. We had warm baguette with salty butter for appetiser. I had the summer orzo, a mouth-watering, creamy, delicious vegetarian dish, a glass of wine and the creme caramel whilst my partner had veal chop with blue cheese butter, a chocolate pot and a glass of port. Between us, we paid ¬£110 inc service, not bad for how good the food was. The atmosphere and decor was amazing. Service was outstanding. Really really enjoyed it and am be keen to come back."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"These two know how to do restaurants and they know how to do French. A menu full of classics - think rabbit in mustard sauce, kidneys, escargot and celeriac remoulade - of the type sometimes difficult to find when you‚Äôre actually in France. Lovely."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Fantastic French food in a very nice setting. The food is really great and has that rustic quality that you could find in a forgotten village in the middle of nowhere in France; the bayonet ham with celeriac remoulade was perfect, the chicken liver p√¢t√© with cornichons was outstanding and the rabbit with bacon and mustard dressing was superb. The dessert was a creme caramel with Armagnac and prunes and I had also the petit pot au chocolat. Both very good . The service is attentive and competent. I suggest to go in a group of at least 3-4 people as there were so many things in the menu that I would have loved to taste but couldn‚Äôt as I was on my own . The cuisine is the kind of French food that uses everything, including parts of the animal that we are not used to taste anymore ; it is cooked with love and precision and it is similar to the kind of cooking made by French grandmothers who were able to conjure up amazingly satisfying meals with whatever they had in the kitchen .  The wine list is good and very reasonably priced. Book in advance and go"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Amazing food, really good service they were lovely and helpful- Cr√®me caramel is my favourite dessert and the one here was delicious!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"We came for a mid week dinner and really enjoyed the food, service, atmosphere. The space is also really nice and lovely. Between the three of us, we shared a bottle of white, the oysters (so fresh), bayonne ham with celeriac, chicken liver pate (both good) for starters, orzo with wild mushrooms and herbs (really rich but tasty), rabbit, mustard and bacon (nice flavour), dover sole meuniere (nicely cooked and was my favourite!) with a side of chips (these were just ok) for mains and the meringue montmorency for dessert. As most of the dishes are rich, I recommend sharing all the dishes so you can try a bit of everything. The menu changes often so I am looking forward to going back at some point. Staff were really friendly, attentive and helpful too!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The service was impeccable. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, and genuinely passionate about the menu, guiding us through the choices with expertise and enthusiasm.  Their recommendations were spot-on, and they were always present without being intrusive.The food itself was nothing short of extraordinary. Each dish was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation, showcasing the chef's mastery of technique and creativity.  The ingredients were clearly fresh, seasonal, and of the highest quality.  We started with the [mention a specific appetizer you liked, e.g., escargots, which were cooked to perfection], followed by the [mention a specific main course, e.g., perfectly seared duck breast, a symphony of textures and tastes].  The [mention a specific side dish, e.g., creamy polenta] was a wonderful complement. And the dessert?  Simply divine!  [Mention the dessert and your reaction].The wine list was extensive and impressive, offering a wide selection to pair perfectly with the menu.  Our sommelier's suggestions were excellent, enhancing our dining experience even further."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Attentive service. They come to you with a huge slate with hand written items and take care to explain all of them :)

Nice and cosy atmosphere. I really love this place. Food really stands out. Smaller portions but very richly prepared, amazing bread, lots of meat options. Truly authentic French as far as I can tell :)"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Social media was right on this one! First of all, the team was very friendly and likeable! They also didn‚Äôt rush us out after lunch, so we could talk and enjoy our food in a relaxed way.

Secondly, we sat near the windows and that area was so well-lit by the daylight! Beautiful! And because it was winter, they had the heating on, another major plus.

For the food, such great flavours. I had the hake as a main and it was very light. I‚Äôd never had escargot before, but after having it here, I can definitely recommend it. Not too chewy and the garlic butter wasn‚Äôt overpowering at all.

I‚Äôd love to go back, what a gem of a place."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The service was perfection, perhaps the best I have ever experienced in London. Loved the wine selection; what a delight to see a Vermouth Rouge on the aperitif list. The creamed spinach was a highlight!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"A Hidden Gem with Timeless French Elegance

Bouchon Racine is an absolute treasure. From the moment you step inside, you‚Äôre transported straight to a classic French bouchon‚Äîwarm, intimate, and effortlessly charming. The service is impeccable: attentive without being overbearing, and genuinely passionate about the food and wine they serve.

The menu is a love letter to traditional French cuisine. I had the oeufs mayonnaise to start‚Äîperfectly balanced and simple in the best way. The andouillette was bold and beautifully prepared, and the gratin dauphinois was the ultimate comfort dish, creamy and rich without being heavy. Every bite felt like it had a story behind it.

The wine list is thoughtfully curated with a strong focus on small French producers, and the staff are more than happy to guide you through it.

Whether you‚Äôre a long-time Francophile or just looking for a memorable dining experience, Bouchon Racine delivers in every way. I can‚Äôt wait to return."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,The magret de canard and the creme caramel were perfect. The prince de paris and the steak tartare were good too. Can‚Äôt wait to go back and try the rest of the dishes.
Bouchon Racine,1.0,"I‚Äôd love to be able to reviewing them restaurant but there are no slots within 30 days unless you want to eat at the dead of night or in the middle of the day on a work day.

I called and called. Left messages. No answer. Emailed; no answer.

Waste of time. Would not recommend"
Bouchon Racine,4.0,"Very cosy atmosphere and ambience. Friendly staff. Overall, my experience was positive. All the mains were great. I particularly enjoyed the cote de boeuf. Starters and desserts however could be improved. The mont blanc dessert was far from what you get in France.
You really need to like french cuisine or you will be disappointed. Also, if you are vegetarian I suggest you go elsewhere as there was only one option on the menu.
All in all, I would recommend giving Bouchon Racine a try üëç"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Fantastic food in a relaxed airy bistro. The duck was particularly impressive as was the rabbit, which was accompanied by some truly exquisite bacon.
Great service rounded off the experience - highly recommend!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"I just loved it.  Friend had booked a late table on a Tuesday night and there was still so much atmosphere.  The team were professional and charming.  The place is intimate yet cool.  Loved the blackboard menu.
Food was beautiful.  Good portion size.
I need to go back.  I had no room for dessert and there is still so much I want to try from the menu.  Mainly the t√™te de veau."

Waitress... ""Are ya done yet?"" Thats how she addressed me ""yes""
Multiple times too!

If you sell decent food you need to back your customers up with a decent attitude.
The foods pretty basic too on its premise. So at these prices I would demand perfection..
Celebrity chef reviews, we won this blah blah, not good enough if you don't back it up with service..
Will never go back."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,The food is really outstanding! Every meal we had was full of flavor and cooked to perfection
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Tucked away in the heart of London, this French gem offers a charming escape to Paris without ever leaving the city. The atmosphere is effortlessly elegant‚Äîthink soft candlelight, tasteful d√©cor, and the kind of quiet buzz that makes conversation feel special.
Service was warm and professional, with staff who clearly know and love their food. The sommelier recommended a Burgundy red that paired beautifully with our meal."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Amazing restaurant,I have been a chef for over 20 years and eat out a lot and this is by far the best French food I have ever had! Top notch!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic lunch!
Such a beautiful restaurant!
Intimate, friendly, special.
The chefs produced the most exquisite flavours, which we devoured!
Audrey was very knowledgeable about all the wines and was lovely too.
Highly recommend this restaurant, it‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs delicious and it‚Äôs small and intimate. Everything is done in front of you, absolutely loved it!
Will be back, I wish Andy continued success."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great experience. Fantastic for those who love seafood, as it's the focus of their menu. They're not necessarily pushing boundaries with their cooking, but their quality and skill is undoubted. Very well deserved of their michelin star, probably one of our favorite 1-star restaurants in London now."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Behind is an absolute gem, easily the best meal I‚Äôve had this year. From the moment you step inside, the atmosphere feels warm, refined, and welcoming. The open kitchen concept makes dining here an incredible experience ‚Äì you get to watch a passionate, highly skilled team at work, and the precision and artistry behind every plate is mesmerising.

The food is exceptional. Every course is beautifully thought out, with bold flavours balanced perfectly and ingredients allowed to truly shine. You can tell there is genuine care and creativity behind every dish, and the pacing of the tasting menu is spot on. The wine pairings were equally impressive, elevating the whole evening.

Service was faultless ‚Äì attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable, and genuinely enthusiastic. It‚Äôs rare to find a place where every detail, from presentation to hospitality, feels so considered.

Well done Andy and team üëèüèº"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Excellent in all ways. Incredible flavours with a wide range, from fresh asian to rich french styles. Brilliant, especially for pescatarians"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"It was a fantastic experience, showing just how unique flavours can come from simple ingredients. Perfect for seafood lovers, though they‚Äôre more than happy to accommodate non-meat eaters as well. While we expected mostly seafood, the chef surprised us with refreshing herb sorbets and fruity shots between courses, which was a delightful touch. The atmosphere is definitely more relaxed than most fine dining spots, with soft lighting and mellow music adding to the charm. The chefs were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making it feel almost like dining at home with friends. And don‚Äôt miss out on checking the unique restrooms while you‚Äôre there."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing. Incredible. Phenomenal. What a bloody treat! Went there last night and from start to finish it was incredible. The ten courses each had their own spectacular taste and we decided to go with the wine pairing - the wine glasses were extremely generous. The restaurant was very accommodating to my allergies - they even remembered them and the dish i had as a replacement was potentially my favourite (i did mention for it to be put back on the menu!). Really thank you for such an incredible night, we really won‚Äôt forget it. Special mention to Connor, Audrey, Olivier, Giorgio and Andy (sorry if I missed anyone). Will be telling everyone about this night for many years to come."
Behind Restaurant,4.0,"Good food and creative dishes at Behind.

Had the tasting menu on the 7th of February.

Highlights is the broth dish and the ice cream in the end! The apple skin and carrot juice is also amazing and very refreshing!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"What a place! The food was fantastic. This is probably my favourite spot I‚Äôve been to in London. Interesting seafood focused food with some twists. They use the sauce and natural ingredients for the flavour no unnecessary added salt or sugar here - really packs a punch. The head chef is a lovely chap as well and so are his staff - the front of house staff member and the other chefs / servers were also great. Lean and effective team. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. They could also accommodate me being a pescatarian as well very easily and didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it (just let
them know in advance). To top it all off my girlfriend and I had a lovely bottle of rose. They‚Äôve nailed the design inside and the vibe is cool but not over the top. Nothing too fancy. Spot on."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,A super friendly and down to earth team serving exquisite food from multiple influences. Such a great experience!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Incredible experience here at Behind. From the moment we stepped in we felt special and truly part of an experience. Starting off with incredible drinks from the sommelier who really knew what she was doing to being served our courses by the chefs themselves. Each course was special within its own right but led beautifully to the next. If you want to truly taste something amazing in London then you must book the tasting menu here!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Here‚Äôs a great example of a Michelin-experience made right.

Setting is a very design-friendly chefs table with the perfect ambience and acoustics. Service is right on point with great hosting, relaxed conversations and highly knowledgeable about their food and preparation.

The food follows the key. Perfectly, and thoughtfully, balanced and prepared to give you something from the whole taste palate.

Went for the lunch set-menu, which was very good value-for-monetary ¬£64pp. Highly recommend other to do the same, or entrust them for a dinner. I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

- Value for money? Yes
- Worth a detour? Yes
- Best for (occasion)? Foodie experience
- Would I go back? Absolutely"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Seafood, made magic. The mixture of textures alone on each dish will surprise you in the best possible way. A delight."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"From the moment we walked in, the service at this restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. The waitstaff were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely warm, striking the perfect balance between professionalism and friendliness.

As for the food and drinks‚Äîdivine is the only word that fits. Every dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor, clearly crafted with care and fresh ingredients. The cocktails were equally impressive, with a creative flair and perfect balance.

This place delivers an experience that delights all the senses. Highly recommended."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Had the most unforgettable dining experience at Behind.

The intimate setting, paired with a warm and passionate team, set the stage for a stunning 10-course seafood tasting menu that was nothing short of artful. Each dish was incredible, but the standouts for me were the scallop with kipper sauce and the Sicilian red prawn. I‚Äôm still dreaming about them."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Every dish was superb these chefs know what they‚Äôre doing‚Ä¶created an amazing space to enjoy amazing seafood fine dining. One of my favourite restaurants in London.

All dishes are served by the chefs themselves no waiters no menus everything is a surprise and explained by the chefs. Definitely a food experience. Highly recommended."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"I heard so many good things about this place before I decided to make a reservation. To be honest, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of seafood but I was convinced to give this place a shot and safe to say I was not disappointed at all.

8-course tasting menu ¬£118 pp (when i went) and one-seating per night. Unlike some fine dining restaurants, Behind was bang for buck. Each dish was well crafted with a lot of thought put into it.

I would say that I felt like the food had a lot of elements of Japanese-like flavours which was very much to my palette!"
Behind Restaurant,4.0,"I recently had the opportunity to dine at this chef's table, known for its surprise seafood-focused menu. Here's my take on t to he experience.

The service was a bit of a mixed bag. It wasn't unfriendly, but it didn't quite exude the warmth you'd hope for in a dining establishment. It seemed as though the staff were efficient but not overly engaging.

Now, onto the food. The meal started on a high note with the first few dishes, which were truly enjoyable.

However, it was disappointing that the latter dishes were marred by excessive saltiness, which left a less than pleasant aftertaste. It was a sharp contrast to the promising start.

Overall, dining here is indeed an experience, but it may not be one that compels me to return. While the surprise menu and the initial courses were memorable, the inconsistency in service and food quality left a lot to be desired. If you're an adventurous diner looking for something different, it might be worth a try, but be prepared for a mixed experience."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Exceptional, if you haven‚Äôt been there you need to go. A unique experience and more than worthy of its Michelin star"
Behind Restaurant,1.0,"It‚Äôs the worst Michelin restaurant experiences I‚Äôve ever had, especially the service part. Chef Andy Beynon is very rude. There are way better Michelin (and non Michelin) restaurants elsewhere.

I arrived on time while my friend was late.
There was miscommunication about the serving with the manager at the beginning as I asked if they can save for my friend what she might miss and serve her when she arrives. She says they will try accommodate. In that case, when the chef Andy later came and ask me if I want to start or wait for my friend, I said I‚Äôll wait. What he didn‚Äôt mention at all is that if I don‚Äôt start without my friend I won‚Äôt be served some of the first courses. Neither on the booking email or on their website says ‚ÄòFood is STRICTLY served all together with all guests and you as a guest paying us money for an experience won‚Äôt be served the food even if we agreed to accommodate a situation.‚Äô He says it‚Äôs ‚Äôobvious‚Äô when he asked me if I want to start. When I asked about it later after realising I was not served the first few courses he said ‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt get it because your friend was late. Nothing I can do and I have no solution.‚Äô No smile, cold face, great customer service."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Sitting at the chef's table was an amazing experience. Alongside only 8 other guests, we watched the chefs prepare and serve our meals while taking the time to explain them to us. The place felt cozy and stylish and talking to the chefs made it very special. Just for this, they deserve top marks.

As for the food, it was mostly fish dishes. The meal started with mackerel and trout, both with surprising flavors that balanced well. Everything was nicely done. The prawn broth and pumpkin crab ravioli were my favorites. The cod cheek looked great but tasted too salty and needed something more, maybe a bit of sourness. But that didn‚Äôt impact our 5 star experience."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"A true masterpiece of fine dining, this world-class restaurant delivers an unforgettable experience. The service is flawless, the ambiance is refined, and every dish is a work of art‚Äîboth visually and in flavor. Highlights include expertly prepared courses, thoughtful wine pairings, and a kitchen that blends precision with creativity. From start to finish, it‚Äôs a seamless journey through culinary excellence."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"This was my birthday treat and absolutely one of the best meals I've ever eaten.  The room is amazing, the cooking is exceptional and the staff wonderful.

Impossible to pick a standout course as every dish was fabulous, having everything brought by the chefs was lovely and Andy is an incredibly talented man and a genuinely lovely person."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great overall experience and delicious food. The tasting menu was well crafted and creative, focused mainly on fresh seafood. The layout of the restaurant and the atmosphere was excellent as all the guests sits facing the open kitchen and see the food being prepared. Service was also brilliant as the staff will give you a brief intro of each dish. Highly recommended."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Our six-course chef's tasting lunch menu at Behind was a special treat. Five chefs and no wait staff. The chefs served and explained the dishes one by one. The visual feast, the intense flavours, the anticipation as we watched them working in the kitchen and plating to perfection ‚Äì it all added up to a supremely special experience. I do wish they'd given us a menu because there was an incredible amount of detail in every dish and I can't remember it all.

The photos show all five chefs at work. The first course was the only one that had more than one component ‚Äì four in all. The silky striped sauce was added at the table to great effect. Two or three trout eggs are nestled amongst the edible flowers. The tasty crispy cracker was so thin it melted in your mouth. The next course was half a quail egg filled with teensy little shrimp with tiny black eyes surrounded by delicate ramen and ""sea ramen."" All eaten with a utensil that looked like a small pair of tongs, much easier to wield than chopsticks. On finishing, we were advised to pick up the bowl and slurp down the divine broth. The dessert was some of the best chocolate I've ever had with another cracker, sweet this time, and a perfect quenelle of ice cream in between. (My daughter told me that's what it's called - she's passionate about food and researches where to eat whenever I visit her in London from Canada.)

We also really enjoyed the five chefs and their multiple nationalities and accents. A marvellous experience overall."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Wonderful dining experience. All the dishes tasted amazing. Love the relaxing atmosphere. They have a small team of chefs and staffs, yet they are all very friendly. Great value for money. Highly recommend this restaurant!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Going to Behind is an experience.
We went to a lot of great restaurants already, but this one is special. The chefs are doing The cooking which you can see from your seats and at the same time they are also serving it. The chef Andy Beynon is super friendly and talks with the guests and explains if necessary. It is a super great, casual atmosphere and a different approach to a Michelin Star restaurant.
The menu is super nice and it becomes better and better from course to course. The chocolate dessert is the best I ever had! I really cannot understand how you can still be hungry afterwards. It was really a special night."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Excellent menu, great atmosphere. All cooking is done in front of you so it makes it a little interactive as well. Servings are well spaced out and not too slow as other reviews mention. Plenty of food overall, with some great flavours and textures. The brioche croissant is unbelievable. Would come again."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Today's food experience was lunch at @behindrestaurant in London Fields, London. The surprise seafood-focused menu was sensational. From the minute I arrived, there was chatty conversation from the chefs who then cooked and served each of the courses. Such a fun afternoon with a front row seat to some really fabulous food."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"A must go if you‚Äôre a foodie in London restaurant scene. Chefs table style design. Amazing fish menu where you find out whilst you eat and they surprise you with each and one of the dishes. Service is phenomenal, shout out to Nathan and Jonny who made our stay one to remember."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing food and service. Very unique and intimate experience, with only 12 other diners. Open kitchen concept allows you to admire the craft and art that goes into the food. Glad I got to try this place out and would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"The food and service were absolutely sublime. The savoury dishes were all perfection, my personal favourite being the chicken and Sea Bream. Magical, only downside is the shared bathroom with the hotel."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Behind offers an exceptional dining experience with its unique open-kitchen concept, allowing diners to witness the artistry behind each dish. The tasting menu is a delightful journey of flavors, showcasing seasonal ingredients and creative combinations. Each course is beautifully presented and thoughtfully prepared. The staff is knowledgeable and attentive, enhancing the overall experience. A must-visit for those who appreciate fine dining with a personal touch"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing Dinner, outstanding service, My out of town guest was very impressed. Every dish on the menu was carefully designed to match the highest standard and exceeded our taste buds expectations."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Can‚Äôt fault it! Amazing seafood-based tasting menu with combination of great flavours. Modern open plan set-up but feel very cosy. Chefs introduced each dish to us when serving and it was a very enjoyable and personal dining experience.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great laidback atmosphere with fantastic food. Very good prize-value proposition for a tasting menu of such quality in London.

Definitely recommend, specially for someone who wants to try their first one-star Michelin Restaurant. Or whoever wants to have good produce with inventive combinations of flavours without paying a fortune.

Would advise them to have a landline in case customers need to reach them (which was my case)."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"A remarkable, intimate and truly delicious lunch. I highly recommend it for lunch or dinner. The room is so beautiful and the service was impeccable. Chefs will serve and then discuss the dishes. Don‚Äôt miss Behind üôåüèª"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Went here for my birthday and really enjoyed my time there! A seafood inspired restaurant in Hackneyü§© would love to revisit but sadly they don‚Äôt give birthday surprises..
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"6 stars all round. Inconspicuous setting for such an elaborate and lavish occasion. Sumptuous interior design elements underpinning the attention to detail for the whole operation - from greeting to goodbye.

And the food reflects all of the above and so much more. Confident, almost effortless flavour combinations."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Andy Beynon's restaurant is a wonderful space that reflects his passion and drive. There is an 18-cover copper horseshoe counter encircling the kitchen with a couple of rectangular tables almost in the kitchen space itself, all with fantastic views of the meal as it is being prepared. The ceiling is warehouse bare and the music reflects Beynon's personal tastes and is balanced to the course being offered. Beynon is an accomplished chef and a charming host. The chef and his brigade are part of the service at Behind, talking to diners about each dish as it is presented to them.

I have sampled some of Beynon's creations at City and Pollen Street Socials, when he was Jason Atherton's development chef, as well as at Hibiscus where he supported Claude Bosi. He has imagination and flair and it is little surprise that he landed a Michelin star within 21 days of opening his own place.

We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu as a surprise (i.e. we did not want to know in advance what we would be eating). The whole room gets the same meal, with slight adaptions for dietary requirements. We also asked for the wine pairing. It is clear from the wine list that Beynon values artisan producers and is ethically inclined - there are many organic options from small vineyards across the globe.

The main focus is on seafood, sustainable, best-on-the-day produce that is served with care and a keen attention to detail. The brigade are not trapped at a particular station but move according to their role, as well as coming out of the kitchen to present their creations. On our visit we enjoyed fresh peas, smoked trout and pike garnished with trout roe, served in a paper thin fine pastry shell with pea shoots - a wonderful, textured mouthful; native oyster taco and oyster with cucumber, buttermilk, horseradish and oyster foam; crab pannacotta with white meat and sliced sharp gooseberries from Beynon's mother's allotment - a successful combination that has made more people than just his mother smile; another crab dish with ajo blanco and melon and cucumber balls with a warm crab broth and fine sardine toast; scallops with pickled fennel; wonderous hake, roasted, in a sherry sauce, served with fish croquettes coated in crisp scales and a silky, smoky mash scattered with seeds (the wine pairing to this was sublime - a glorious Spanish Red tasting of smoked Ribena); tender 7 day-hung guinea fowl accompanied by a superb South African granache from Wellington; a potion of rhubarb served in a tall glass with a foam to cleanse the palate; a subtle herb sorbet (basil, tarragon and verbena) served with lemon curd custard - quite sublime with a sharp raspberry and calamari sorbet with white strawberries as a refreshing finisher; a white chocolate and cardamom bomb; and a going home gift of freshly baked brioche pastry to go with coffee next day - a delicious reminder of the night before.

Beynon is a cool Hackney resident running a very cool Hackney venue. That he finds time to be a loving father and husband on top of steering his culinary dream is amazing. He recruited one of his brigade when the pair of them were taking their kids out for a stroll and recognised each other and got talking. Great to live and work locally at such a fantastic restaurant. Thank you for wonderful evening."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"This is the ultimate restaurant for all seafood lovers who want to experience a unique tasting menu using only the best products the UK waters have to offer.
My partner and I had a delicious anniversary celebration and we enjoyed every single bite of their seafood tasting menu - thank you team!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Sublime. We had a great time, food was amazing and so were the staff. Weve been to Michelin Star places and often leave wallet lighter & thinking nothing more than 'it was ok'. Not here, here I felt like I had my first Michelin star experience. The food is art on a plate and each plate an explosion of flavour. Their wine paring is by far the most generous Ive ever had, we both left a little bit wobbly on our feet.

If you love seafood you will love this place."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"We had dinner in this restaurant a few days ago- highly recommended place! Very affordable prices, nice and friendly waitresses. Definitely one of our favorite restaurant now! 10/10"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Very nice experience at Behind Restaurant.  From start to finish each dish is a new experience of tastes and flavors.
Each cooking is measured to perfection.
The dishes are balanced and respect each product.
Having less even worked at ""La Tante Claire"" with Pierre Kaufmann, at ""The Terrasse restaurant"" at the Dorchester, ""the Waterside Inn"", with Michel Roux and also at the ""Gravetye Manor"".
I can only congratulate chef Andy Beynon and  his entire team for the work accomplished.
Continue to work and respect the fresh products you serve us.
Once again congratulations for this wonderful moment."
Behind Restaurant,4.0,"1 Michelin star spot with a great sweeping wooden table top counter dining that seated 14 around it. Very close to brat at climpsons arch in London fields. Firstly the staff were all fantastic - the chefs served all the dishes and were really approachable and great to chat about the food and menu with. The sommelier was also particularly friendly and knowledgeable and just a lovely person. Really nice to see Andy Beynon himself taking time to chat with all the diners in the restaurant and clearly took pride in his food and the restaurant.

In terms of the food itself, it‚Äôs a surprise seafood focussed tasting menu (you get the menu at the end as a takeaway), with c.14 courses which means each is relatively small and ultimately very ‚Äúfine dining‚Äù if you know what I mean, but not necessarily in a good way. Whilst everything was cooked well with ok flavours, it‚Äôs hard to classify many of the dishes as truly standout that you are going to be yearning for over the next few days/weeks/months or raving about to friends and family. It was all technically proficient cooking for sure but would love to see some more innovative ideas on the plate and more knockout flavours. Crab, hake, and guinea fowl dishes were the highlights for us. Total bill c.¬£208 for two with a couple of drinks each. Overall 13/20"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Absolutely loved this place. Every course was amazing which is rare to hit it all and also very reasonably priced. Very seafood heavy but I love seafood and the mash was just ridiculous! Thank you for the best evening!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"So lucky to be able to finally get a reservation!! Absolutely amazing, I had a wonderful time. All o the dishes were delightful. It was definitely an experience."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Absolutely amazing!! The food was an excellent mix of interesting flavours. The staff were absolutely lovely & the wine pairings were perfect. Such a treat & worth every penny!!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Loved our meal here - each dish was delicious and the whole open plan vibe of the restaurant made it feel really intimate. Not the sort of place I would visit frequently but an ideal place for a treat!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Food was absolutely incredible and overall a wonderful experience from Andy and his team. Personal and Intimate setting. A hidden gem in East London, everyone must go. A well deserved Michelin star!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Came here for friend‚Äôs birthday. Had very high expectations and it was decent. We were still hungry after the tasting lunch menu though üòÇ
Behind Restaurant,2.0,"Big disappointment

Portions are tasty but very small and I was still hungry after the 8 courses tasting menu. The chef proposed an extra dessert for customers who were still hungry like me. I thought it was going to be free but was charged extra.
The service is good but it was the first time I left a Michelin star restaurant hungry and wanting for more, even after spending 300 pounds for 2 people."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,10 courses served over 3 hours. Brilliant food and wine pairing as well as amazing service.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Lovely space and atmosphere. Enjoyed the seating arrangement where you can watch the chat with the chefs. Enjoyed the fish based concept and the wine pairing was amazing.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"East London is spoilt for choice with regards to fantastic eateries and Behind is another welcomed addition to the scene. Fantastic seafood focused tasting menu, and their sardine on toast something out of this world.  Cannot fault anything."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"We had an incredible time at Behind with Andy, Jimmy and the crew.  The tasting lunch menu with wine pairing was simply sublime from start to finish - all I can say is just go."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Wow fine dining at its very very best. The food the chef's served up were nothing more than spectacular. The staff were very friendly and polite. The atmosphere was perfect dining with friends. I can't wait to go back
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"phenomenal!! andy gets the atmosphere and vibe perfect. great food served by the chefs in a casual laidback style - the team are great. the cooking is balanced and refined - exploring a few different cuisines (the mini-ramen was one of my favourites). and the wine pairing was very well selected and in tune with the foods,  I like the use of some smaller producers you might not have tried before. Next time i‚Äôm in London this will be the first thing i book!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic restaurant. Food was delicious and hot . The service was incredible. The staff was so approachable, nothing was to much trouble for them . The menu has plenty of choices . Will definitely be returning when in that area .
A must go to ."
Behind Restaurant,3.0,"Pros: The room design is unique and chefs will make you feel like a king with a fairly personalized service; flavours are pretty good; lunch menu is quite affordable too. Having said that, some cons you need to consider: 1) lots of downtime ‚Ä¶"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Superb. beyond/behind superb meal. Wonderful to watch the chefs prepare the food and serve it so deftly and in a chilled way. Fish and seafood for 2021. Book early and enjoy. Fully worth the price (and get the wine pairing).
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Food is exceptional. This restaurant has some of the freshest food I have ever tasted. The meat is top quality. I highly highly recommend this restaurant.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,One of the best fine dining/tasting menu I have ever had in London. The food was very tasty and creative. They served all types of seafood that I love. The time between dishes was perfect. The portion was just right. We left the restaurant comfortably full and happy. Highly recommended
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Behind Restaurant is located in the heart of Sidworth. The waiter was impressively welcoming, knowledgeable of the menu and made expert suggestions. The food was great and really good value for money. The atmosphere of the restaurant was ‚Ä¶"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Fantastic restaurant with an amazing tasting menu and tasty wine pairing option. It is a great combination of a down-to-earth Hackney style and up market dining.

Behind Restaurant,5.0,"We enjoyed the most wonderful dinner there. It was delicious, beautifully executed, and just superb.

It's rare to have head chef so involved in service and customer care. Really nice experience!"

It's lovely to observe talented chefs create masterpiece after masterpiece using ‚Ä¶"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"One of the best fine dining experiences we've had.  the atmosphere was a perfect blend of professionalism and friendliness, elegant yet relaxed and welcoming.

Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Warm lighting and hospitality, delicious blends of taste. We indulged in their 6 course lunch tasting menu. Would highly recommend."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Service was impeccable‚Äîattentive but never intrusive. The staff were knowledgeable about the menu and happy to recommend wine pairings from their impressive selection.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Truly outstanding. Course after course all delivered by the chefs themselves (along with an excellent sommelier).
Great environment and wonderful food."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great restaurant with charming and passionate chef - great intimate experience, lovely fine dishes and superb service - one of the most lovely restaurants of London (and of East London for sure!)"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"My wife and I had truly wonderful experience at Mount Street Restaurant. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome ‚Äì their warmth, attentiveness, and professionalism really stood out and added so much to the visit.

The food was absolutely exceptional ‚Äì every dish was beautifully presented and full of rich, fresh flavours that exceeded my expectations.

What made the visit even more special was the private tour I had of the restaurant's impressive artwork collection and private dining spaces. The art pieces are stunning and thoughtfully curated, adding a unique charm to the venue.

Overall, Mount Street Restaurant offers not only outstanding food but also an unforgettable atmosphere, thanks to its amazing staff and beautiful surroundings. We can‚Äôt wait to return!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"The visit of  the Mount St. Restaurant  brought pleasure for me and my loved ones. The restaurant combines wide selection of fine arts, impressive interior design and sophisticated cuisine. Thus, the guests receive a delight for both the eyes and the palate. Two of us took the London butter lettuce salad; the Aubergine schnitzel and the Tart of caramelised onions, goat‚Äôs curd & spring vegetables. The other two tried the Aubergine schnitzel and the Orkney scallop scampi with warm tartare sauce. Everything was delicious, but the dessert really moved us and brought joy and excitement - Dark chocolate & coffee tart with roasted vanilla ice cream and Choux bun, Guernsey vanilla cream with hot chocolate sauceüòã The wine list is wide, with a predominance of more expensive wines. The service is polite and unobtrusive. Thank you for the fulfilling evening üôè"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Excellent lunch at Mount street restaurant. The scallop scampi was absolutely delicious, and the Dover sole a perfect example, sauces, seasoning, ingredients and service all spot on. Loved it and will definitely return"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Absolutely loved this place for brunch! The vibe was cozy and welcoming, and the food was top-notch. What really stood out was the service - our waitress was incredibly warm and friendly. She took the time to walk us through the British items on the menu (which we weren‚Äôt super familiar with), explaining everything in such a thoughtful and approachable way. You could tell she genuinely cared that we had a great experience. This spot is a gem!"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,A lovely restaurant on one of the prettiest streets in London. We came for dinner and of course had to try the signature lobster pie for two. The dish is pricey but does have an impressive amount of lobster inside so you won‚Äôt feel ripped off by the experience.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Truly an elevated dining experience with perhaps the best Sunday roast in London. The scallops dish was out of this world. Primo service in a beautiful setting. Highly recommended culinary experience.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Breakfast was pure decadence. The Arnold Bennett omelette was so rich and beautifully executed, it‚Äôs etched into my taste buds forever ‚Äî truly unforgettable. The d√©cor is just as remarkable: distinctive, refined, and utterly signature. Everything about the space feels curated for indulgence. A must-visit if you‚Äôre craving luxury from the very first bite of the day."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"There is a lot more to the mount steet restaurant than just the ¬£110 lobster ü¶û pie - they also have great scallop scampi, great omelette arnold bennett, great desserts, sexy salt and pepper butt plug shakers and some of the best private dinning rooms in London üá¨üáß

Make sure you add Mount street restaurant to your list of restaurants to visit"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Empirically fine in all aspects - just a bit stuffy and overpriced. I want to call it uninspired but that feels too harsh. If I remove my personal taste and expectations, it may be someone else's 5 out of 5. That said, Mount St. simply takes itself too seriously.. great place if you want to impress your partner's grandparents or want a reminder of why we've evolved past what we thought was fancy in the late 90s."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"If you love art and food, this place is for you. The walls are adorned with wonderful art and you could be fooled into thinking that you were sat in a private members club! Service is professional and attentive. The food also wonderful. Our children absolutely love breakfast here!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Celebrated a lunch birthday here and we were all very impressed by the service and food. You need to book in advance.

The lobster pie is a standout and has big prices of lobster meat, cooked in a lobster broth. It‚Äôs absolutely delicious with strong flavours.

The Sunday roast was also just as good, the beef moist, with the some of the best potatoes we‚Äôve ever had. The desserts are out of this world, and are made to order - and it shows.

Highly recommend, and would come again.

Tips:
- make sure you book in advance
- there is a 15% service charge"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Nothing but amazing things to say about our visit today.
The food was sublime
The service was amazing
The bill was damn reasonable
Special mentions to Betty and Erina for making our visit so special .
This is somewhere we will 100% be coming back to next time for dinner.
So glad I ignore some reviews on here and do my own due diligence
Happy Xmas Mount st gang London dining at its finest"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Mount Street is a beautiful location and an elegant restaurant. The art (Matisse!) is stunning and well curated but clashes with some questionable design choices like the weird table lamps or the sad ceiling. Beautiful chairs and color harmony though. Also tables for two are extremely close considering how spacious the place is.
I did have some issues during my dinner.
The infamous lobster pie was not presented on the table, just briefly shown, and poorly presented on plates. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, food wise Mount Street is very good, the lemon pie to die for, but the wine list is outrageously pricey, the fairly traditional menu too. You get Michelin star prices but not the level of creativity or perfection.
Walking through, a group of waiters were chatting with each other and didn‚Äôt even stopped or moved when I had to pass through them to get to my table! If we‚Äôre talking Mayfair prestige restaurant you would expect a much better environment sorry. After my slightly underwhelming dinner, I kept thinking that the attention to details and service are probably much higher for a certain type of customer as you can see on social media. A trend I have been used to in high end New York/ LA restaurants but it‚Äôs disappointing to see in London."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We had an amazing dinner tonight at Mount St. restaurant. The food was fantastic as were the cocktails and wine list. While the restaurant is great for a small group of adults (they have larger private rooms), or a date with another, we had our children with us and were happy to see they had a children‚Äôs menu (many restaurants in Mayfair don‚Äôt) and welcomed us. Our server, Betty, was lovely. She and her colleagues provided us the best service we have had at a London restaurant. The art on the walls was great to look at too. A great scene of people in Mayfair. We hope to be back soon."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Book in advance and enjoy going up the stairs to the art filled room. Have a Mount St Martini or Smoky Penicillin cocktail while admiring the walls. The croquettes and the beef will delight with perfect execution. The service is on point. I'd say pretty flawless experience. The restaurant is also a great choice on Mayfair for a Sunday roast where everything is excellent.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We hosted a corporate event here last month in The Swiss Room - Let me pass on my thanks to Katie for all of her help in the planning and prep for this event - from the initial meeting and show-round to the actual event yesterday, I felt confident that the event would be a success!
My boss said the food, the wine and the company was all perfect, which is exactly the feedback I would have wanted!
A special thank you to Julie, we actually said if we were hosting another event with yourselves (which we would love to do!) we would specifically request her, we really appreciated the service and how every request we had was seen to.

It's always nice to get lovely feedback not only from the host but also the guests, and everyone has been in contact to rave about the location, the service and the food/drinks.

I think the artwork also went down very well, it was a great talking point and everyone really appreciated the beautiful surroundings!

Thank you very much."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"I had the chance to badge into this restaurant recommended to me by a friend, and it was excellent with the food, hospitality, and the environment.

The food was exceptional with a touch of British culture - the food was well garnished with richness in flavour .

Hospitality was top notch, which exceeded my expectations with friendly but attentive staff commencing my entry with a smile and warmth welcome vibes.

And come to think of it, the environment was clean, the ambience was perfect either for a date, birthdays, anniversaries or any other vital occasions.

Overall, I will say Mount Restaurant was a great place i had experience in the UK."
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"We had a crab crumpet, lobster pie with veggies, and chocolate mousse. Lobster pie especially was tasty with big chunks of lobster meat. Crab crumpet was just fine nothing special."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"WOWZA if you fancy a delicious dinner then you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Big shout to the omelette, the lobster pie, the sole, the wellington (and the truffle mash with that). Just all amazing guys I can‚Äôt quite believe it xxxx"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Service was wonderful, staff were all very welcoming and polite. Bread and butter was served on the house. Ordered the signature lobster pie and was not disappointed, pastry was thin and lobster meat was generous. It‚Äôs very filling for just two people actually. Would probably be perfect sharing amongst three and having some other sides or small plates. Had a crab salad which was on the pricier side for its size (of a palm). Overall great central location and atmosphere for a business lunch."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Mount St. Restaurant ‚Äì Review by Alex

Had a brilliant time at Mount St. Restaurant. The d√©cor is stunning ‚Äî feels more like an art gallery than a restaurant, with original pieces from big names like Warhol and Freud. Every detail, from the mosaic floors to the designer chairs, adds to the experience.

The food really impressed me. I had the mock turtle croquette to start, which was rich and flavourful. The lobster pie for two stole the show ‚Äî dramatic presentation and packed with taste. Dessert was the rhubarb custard soft-serve, simple but full of nostalgia.

Drinks were just as good ‚Äî the wine list is massive, and staff helped me choose the perfect red to match the meal. Pricey, but definitely worth it for a special night"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"This restaurant was arguably one of the best restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to. Went there with my girlfriend and we really had a great time. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was great and also the service was amazing. I highly recommend it especially if you are going on a date or etc."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"fantastic dining spot! Everything exceeded our expectations. We were pleasantly surprised by the lively atmosphere (good crowd)‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt often find in Mayfair. The food was exceptional; the lobster pie was a standout, and the banana souffl√© became my instant favorite. Aesthetically, the restaurant is incredibly chic, with its impressive artwork and creative interior design. Oh, and The service! You definitely feel welcomed as staff is super attentive.
I would gladly return!"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,Classic English menu but in a beautiful setting with art and friendly service at @mountstrestaurant in Mayfair.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"I had an exceptional dining experience at Mount St. Restaurant. The ambiance was sophisticated and intimate, with a beautifully designed interior that exuded elegance. The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff who were knowledgeable about the menu. The food was exquisite, with each dish expertly prepared and presented. The steak was cooked to perfection, and the wine pairing was impressive. While the prices may be on the higher side, it's well worth it for a special occasion. I would highly recommend Mount St. Restaurant to anyone seeking a refined dining experience."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We came here to try the famous lobster pie and weren't disappointed. In fact every element of our meal was superbly crafted, from my ""strawberries and cream"" seabass starter down to the cherry kirsch sponge dessert. And obviously, the showstopper pie, was perfectly cooked and presented. The pastry was buttery and flaky without being dry, and the filling was quite generously portioned with chunks of fresh lobster. It comes with some delicious veg (broad beans, cavolo nero) but we also got some mash on the side which was buttery and smooth. It was perfectly accompanied by a lovely bottle of Chardonnay. The service was attentive and the environment with its dim lighting and artworks was second to none. A real treat."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We found this place while looking for something near by but didn‚Äôt realize what a lovely place it was! The staff was very friendly and the food was perfect! I had the lamb, perfectly cooked, and paired with a zucchini flower that was stuffed. My youngest had an onion tart with mushrooms and beans.

The restaurant was designed by an artist so that it looks like you are eating in an art gallery!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,My favourite restaurant! Probably the best chips in London!
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Booked the Italian rooms for a special Birthday. Lounge and Dining room. Dining Room is suitable for a party of up to 12 guests.
Stefania my contact at the restaurant was very professional which made specific arrangements easy to organise (I got a tour around the restaurant prior to the night I booked).
The ambience and service is excellent and all my guests thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The food was tasty but I wouldn't call it exceptional- that's not saying it was bad in any way. I'd recommend ordering more side dishes, they were quite small and 6 between 12 was barely enough.
The Beef Wellington was beautifully rare and the Butter Lettuce salad was incredibly tasty.
To get the rooms you will need to spend a minimum of ¬£1500 which is not difficult. Deposit is that amount prior to event.
I think this is a cashless restaurant too."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"I recently visited Mount St. Restaurant and had a wonderful experience. The atmosphere is elegant and welcoming, with a beautifully designed interior that feels both modern and classic.

The service was excellent ‚Äî the staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered a steak with seasonal sides, and everything was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. The wine selection was also impressive, with many great options to choose from.

Prices are on the higher side, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it for a special occasion. I would highly recommend Mount St. Restaurant to anyone looking for high-quality food and top-tier service"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Wedding dinner for 15 at the Scottish Room. Food was excellent and service was phenomenal. The team was non-intrusive but keenly attentive - a difficult balance. They went above and beyond in a number of ways. We greatly appreciated everything and would highly recommend for important private family events.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"A beautiful, multi level restaurant with an art focus. The menu is classic but varied, with various caviar, oyster, seafood and meat options. Highlights for us were the lobster pie and beef Wellington.
The beetroot tart was technically well curated but not especially exciting.
Their souffl√© was perfectly made and the chocolate mousse is both airy and rich.
The restaurant itself is worth a visit for the building alone- an old building with interesting and striking art. I love the recipe pieces in the corridor.
Definitely worth trying if you're visiting London and want a Mayfair dining experience, without the pretentiousness of a lot of Mayfair spots, a bit old school, with creative interior. Yet the staff were very sweet and welcoming."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Upstairs at this restaurant is simply stunning, filled with an artistic atmosphere. Surrounded by world-famous paintings, the ambiance is extremely comfortable. Highly recommend for art and food lovers!

üçÉ Located on Mount Street in Mayfair, this restaurant, owned by a gallery owner, features works by Matisse, Picasso, Philip Guston, George Condo, and more. You‚Äôll be amazed by the art and the delicious British cuisine.

üôå Every dish is a delight! The bread with butter and chicken liver p√¢t√© is a must-try, as well as the London butter lettuce salad with blue cheese, pear, and candied walnuts. The beef tartare is one of the best in London, and the Dressed Portland crab salad is a summer specialty.

ü•∞ Desserts are French-inspired with British names, like the classic Eton Mess turned into a cake mousse ‚Äì not too sweet, just perfect!

ü´∂ Definitely a spot I can‚Äòt wait to revisit!"
Mount St. Restaurant,2.0,"Welcome from the senior staff member was a tad snotty, guy on the front door and our waiter were very nice. Loved the art work and floor. Food was decidely average at best - I would not recommend the beef tartare (I requested no egg yolk - it arrived as requested (fine) completely garnish free - quite uninspiring and beef was tasteless, toast waa greasy.. The monkfish dish was not great - I was playing find the potato - finally found four or five tiny balls hiding in the sauce.  The sauce was not well balanced. For the price I was expecting something amazing. I  have eaten much better for much less and don't think I would return."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We had an excellent dinner last night, notable points: the ambience is very elegant, with all the wonderful pieces of art but very relaxed. The cocktails taste great. The wine list is very pricey. The food was delivered to perfection. We picked salads for starters (wonderful taste!) just to have room for the beef Wellington that came perfectly executed and the velvety mash that is a dream. Extra note, as I mentioned that we are celebrating a special occasion during my reservation -being early valentine‚Äôs dinner- they asked us what the celebration was about during dessert and presented us with a lovely chocolate cake. The service is outstanding in all aspects and I would recommend to anyone looking for a good English menu in London"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Superb restaurant all round. Went for Sunday lunch - buzzy atmosphere, great mix of people.

We‚Äôd eaten elsewhere before so just ordered the Lobster pie which was the primary reason for the visit. It delivered. It was full of lobster and perfectly executed.

Everything else was super. Even the Diet Coke came with a metal straw in wonderful glassware with a great amount of ice (subjective I know).

Water was charged at ¬£1.75 per head for unlimited which is a nicer touch than ¬£8 a bottle elsewhere‚Ä¶"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Probably one of the best London restaurants been to where the service is excellent.  Having not decided on the drinks,  told the waiter give us a few min.  And he actually come back in a few min not 15-20 minü§£ thoughtout the all the staff were excellent and the food looks and taste excellent.  Ordered 2 beef wellingtons and the lamb,  Plus sides. Definitely would recommend and return."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Honestly one of the best places I‚Äôve been too will definitely be going again.. never had better service than this place.. thinking about doing my birthday here as the food was exceptional and the staff were great
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic dining experience. The atmosphere was cozy yet elegant, the service was attentive, and every dish was a standout‚Äîfrom the flavorful appetizers to the perfectly cooked main course and decadent dessert. You can tell they care deeply about quality and presentation. Highly recommended‚ÄîI‚Äôll definitely return!"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Interesting dinner. Honestly the art was lost on me as not a personal interest of mine. Service was fantastic with very attentive waiters, smartly dressed and very well informed. Food was average for the price paid. Dishes lacked innovation and substance. Whilst being excatly as advertised you would expect some more complex flavour profiles given the simplicity of the dishes which they didn't have. Personally a 4 star meal. Probably wouldn't return as felt the cost didn't justify the dinning experience. Atmosphere was nice although it did get very loud during the meal making it hard to hear dinner guests, not a easy place to talk with the volume."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We came for a birthday lunch today with our 2 year old. The waitstaff couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating (I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt get their names), they were phenomenal.  We had some issues but they sorted everything out quickly. The food was delicious and the restaurant is beautiful (the ART, my god the ART!). Would definitely return."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,A warm and welcoming place where every detail feels thoughtfully crafted from the comforting aroma that greets you at the door to the genuine smiles that make you feel like part of the family. The food isn‚Äôt just delicious; it tells a story on every plate.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Great traditional English breakfast in a beautiful setting. Such a privilege to dine surrounded by the beautiful artworks. Service was top notch.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,üëç Book in advance and enjoy going up the stairs to the art filled room. Have a Mount St Martini or Smoky Penicillin cocktail while admiring the walls. The croquettes and the beef will delight with perfect execution. The service is on point. I'd say pretty flawless experience. The restaurant is also a great choice on Mayfair for a Sunday roast where everything is excellent.
Mount St. Restaurant,3.0,"Mount Street is a beautiful location and an elegant restaurant. The art (Matisse!) is stunning and well curated but clashes with some questionable design choices like the weird table lamps or the sad ceiling. Beautiful chairs and color harmony though. Also tables for two are extremely close considering how spacious the place is.
I did have some issues during my dinner.
The infamous lobster pie was not presented on the table, just briefly shown, and poorly presented on plates. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, food wise Mount Street is very good, the lemon pie to die for, but the wine list is outrageously pricey, the fairly traditional menu too. You get Michelin star prices but not the level of creativity or perfection.
Walking through, a group of waiters were chatting with each other and didn‚Äôt even stopped or moved when I had to pass through them to get to my table! If we‚Äôre talking Mayfair prestige restaurant you would expect a much better environment sorry. After my slightly underwhelming dinner, I kept thinking that the attention to details and service are probably much higher for a certain type of customer as you can see on social media. A trend I have been used to in high end New York/ LA restaurants but it‚Äôs disappointing to see in London."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"The food is absolutely amazing and worth every penny, along with great professional service throughout the evening. with a friendly and chilled atmosphere I will definitely return."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Central London. It is located in Mayfair, above the Audley Public House, which is also well worth a visit (for a drink or two). This was the 2nd time I dined at the Mount St. Restaurant, and I had the lobster pie (shared with my mother). It's a great dish, worth every penny (¬£96)."
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"We came for Sunday lunch and the interior of the restaurant is beautiful. We shared the lobster pie for two which is quite expensive for ¬£96 but it was filling and had a generous amount of lobster in it. It is rich but tasty. The side of greens it came with was slightly undercooked and quite average and we also got mash on the side which complimented well with the pie. The cocktail was nice but it was ¬£18, so it's on the more expensive side. Staff were polite, courteous and attentive at all times."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Amazing Atmosphere & Food. Can only recommend. The LobsterPie - just brill! Enjoy & thank me later!
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Certainly worth it if you're craving their incredible lobster pie ‚Äì delicious and generously packed with lobster. The side dishes were also incredible. However, the starters didn't quite meet expectations in my opinion."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Great quality & Super child friendly!

So after we were turned down at Scott‚Äôs I was not sure if we find something to eat with our kids in this area. Then we just saw Mount St. Restaurant and asked if they have a table.
Fortunately they did and it was the best decision ever.

The staff is very welcoming (quite a difference to Scott‚Äôs) and child friendly. They‚Äòve even got some wachs colors for the boys. They also have a kids menu. Pasta was very well made.

The adult food was 100 out of 100. Dorado with morels - just awesome. The desserts were also very delicious. On top they had our
Favorite Louis Roederer Rose open. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Service was just outstanding and the staff was very Child friendly!

Thanks a lot, this was our greatest unplanned restaurant experience in London so far! And as a foodie visited multiple Michelin starred restaurants, I know what I talk about!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Absolutely love the food here. The taste is amazing and portions are decent. Reasonable price as well! Nothing to complain about this place. 100% recommended!
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Absolutely amazing! I loved the ambiance of the place as well as the food. the entrance of the resturant is interesting as it is inside of the pub,  inside the building and take the elevator up but they do have an outside entrance with stairs. . The decor was amazing , if you know art very well you will recognise  who the
salt and pepper shakers are by. The tables were nicely spaced out and comfortable. The food was really amazing. The cocktails were very maturely presented and  were flavoured with best alcohol.   We tried many things from the menu and they each came with a really well made presentation, our favourite was the rib eye stake they got medium well done  right ! which most restaurants  do it burnt ! and the  souffl√© desert is best.  I would highly recommend this place as a dining experience, if you are looking for a mayfair  contemporary art experience. Would say it‚Äôs more suitable for couples or small groups. Even the bathroom was amazing. The considerations for the entire experience could be felt in every step. not too pretentious."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of the Fife Arms, and was thrilled by my first visit to Mount St. Restaurant today. Loved the lobster pie! One of those rare dishes that I will find myself remembering from time to time.

Excellent souffl√©. Wonderful staff who gave us a little art tour, as we were the first to arrive for lunch service. Looking forward to many more visits!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Fantastic food and experience. The harmony of flavors and textures was truly expectional a perfect 10üòçthe staff was very friendly and warm.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Me and my girlfriend recently visited this restaurant.And trust me, the food was so amazing.And the service they  provided was absolutely outstanding.I have really the food and Would recommend anybody who wants to have a lovely time and enjoy the lovely food"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,British deliciousness in every bite. The kind of menu that will make me want to go back. Plenty of vegetarian dishes. Lovely staff. Highly recommend.
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Nice art and really excellent service, but food and particularly the lobster pie was kind of mid"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, with a warm and welcoming ambiance. The staff was attentive and friendly, ensuring we were comfortable throughout the meal. The menu offered a variety of options, catering to different dietary preferences.

The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor. The appetizers were fresh and well-seasoned, setting the tone for the rest of the meal. The main course was cooked to perfection, with generous portions and a great balance of textures. Dessert was a highlight, with a rich and indulgent selection that left us wanting more.

Overall, it was a delightful dining experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality food and excellent service."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"A newish addition to the neighbourhood. I question if it is a restaurant or more of a canteen. Not been previously because friend of mine didn‚Äôt like. The food is very good with wonderful sauces and delightful whipped pots of dressing and dips. I had the crab with fresh lettuce. Then the lobster pie and apple crumble souffl√©. The pudding was the best. Flavours divine. The crab light and fresh. The pie an interesting idea - I love pie at the Holborn dining rooms and lobster is a firm favourite (I visit the usa a lot) but lobster pie? The pastry was delicious, the lobster divine. Do they go together? I don‚Äôt think so. However virtually every table was ordering it. (They do have beef wellington - but my companion didn‚Äôt eat beef - shame!) I found the restaurant noisy - one table of 8 was laughing loudly - it got better when the room filled up more. I hear breakfast and lunch are very good so perhaps those are the better time options."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We had the pleasure of working with Megan Lockhart for our high-calibre event, and she was absolutely fantastic. She went above and beyond to ensure everything ran seamlessly, demonstrating incredible attention to detail and professionalism.

Megan was always available, super helpful, and truly made the entire process stress-free. We couldn't have asked for a better events manager and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for an expert to elevate their event. Thank you Megan!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Really good food and lovely staff tasty drinks a fancy place for a date but everything is spot on the atmosphere is so wonderful I really recommend it
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,It was really nice and the food there was tempting and delicious I enjoyed it a lot as well as my family I would surely recommend it!!
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"A really exceptional experience my first at this restaurant for lunch not long after opening. I came here following a review from the critic for the Evening Standard and wasn't disappointed.

Some restaurants can be a tricky when newly opened as they settle in to find their niche, but it's clear that the fine details have been taken care of here across both food, decor and service.

The menu is a mix of British classics with inspiration from traditional French menus but manages to combine fine dining with a genuine kind of 'homeliness' to the food and carries off both contrasting elements well. The luxury ingredients are complemented by generous portion sizes for a restaurant in this local. Generosity is abundant elsewhere in the menu e.g. including a truly delicious chicken parfait with caramelised shallots alongside the usual fare of bread and salted butter.

The Arnold Bennett omelette was as good as any I've had elsewhere in London. While the pigeons in pimlico main was itself a stand out, the addition of bubble and squeak as a side was a true elevation about the usual chips or pur√©e potatoes.

The attention to detail that has been paid to the art on the walls (including originals by Lucian Freude and Matisse among others) is clearly more than just a gimic as the wider decor makes for a very comfortable relaxed dining experience but with the care attention that has gone into the design running throughout and always clear. If I was to nitpick the tiniest of details the only downside was sharing the rest rooms with The Audley Pub below in the basement meant breaking the ambience environment when going there as they were clearly styled to match The Audley more than the restaurant.

This restaurant is clearly carving out a niche in the upper end of the market (but distinct from your usual Michelin type places) and with that comes a cost but although pricey my opinion was that for the quality of food, service, ambience and above all location the menu was good value for money.

Above all I was extremely impressed by the service. Ondrej is a real credit to the restaurant and based on his knowledge and enthusiasm for the entire area, I'd also add to the hospitality industry as a whole. The enthusiasm from all staff was clear and they seemed genuinely delighted to be working there which isn't always the case even when it appears to be.

A testament to how much I rated my first experience despite the restaurant having only been open for a few weeks I have already booked my second visit and can see this becoming a regular favourite."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"This is constructive criticism.
Ambience: Cosy, lively, romantic, comfortable, and relaxed.
Food: we'll prepare, fleuret, visually appealing.
Staff.: Friendly, helpful, Efficient. Friendly, knowledgeable, efficient."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Truly amazing ! Delicious food and lovely atmosphere. The service was lovely and attentive. Highly recommend.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Honestly one of the best restaurants I have ever been to, everything was done to perfection. Highly recommend."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Was absolutely blown away by the food, service, and the art! If you are an art enthusiast of any kind, you should come not only for their cleanly cooked bream and modern take on a beet salad, but their extensive collection of paintings and drawings courtesy of Hauser & Wirth (a blue chip gallery).

The Art: The Paris-based interior design is full of fun facts, from repeating wallpaper printed with a Paul McCarthy statue to the hand-collaged Phyllida Barlow ceiling installed next door at The Audrey Bar (owned by the same people). You will find Fontana, Freud, and Hodler on the walls among many other well curated picks!

Everything else: the food is clean, well portioned, and flavorful with Parisian influences. They accommodated gluten, dairy, and nut allergies for our group with no problem, and our server took the time to explain some of the art collection to us despite it being a busy Friday night. Thank you for a lovely, lovely experience!"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"The food quality has declined. The Sunday brunch Yorkshire pudding was burnt, and the food was served cold. While the service is friendly, the execution in the kitchen needs improvement."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,I loved this restaurant! Such a cool vibe in a quiet neighborhood. The food was excellent and came out very quickly.
Mount St. Restaurant,1.0,"Food was good, ambiente is also pretty nice, but the ‚Äûoptional 15% service charge was automatically added‚Äú is what put me off completely. This is an almost american standard of deception."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Brilliant lobster pie with a side of greens and top notch service.
Mount St. Restaurant,2.0,"The receptionist ‚Äì a British senior ‚Äònot‚Äìso‚Äìgentleman‚Äô ‚Äì set the tone for the evening with a snobbish and rude attitude. You‚Äôd feel more welcome at a local caf√©! Not exactly the warm, polished service you‚Äôd expect ‚Äì and certainly not the best way to start a meal.

(The only good service in the entire place was from our waiter Bartosz!)"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Great Breakfast spot. Haven't done dinner but sure it won't disappoint
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Great menu and good service. Kind people who take care of your experience and cook with love!
Fallow,5.0,"Ate at Fallow last night. Believe the hype, it‚Äôs very good. We were served by Christian, he is an excellent ambassador for the business. His knowledge of the menu and his advice on dishes were really helpful.
The food is innovative, beautiful and tastes amazing. We ate some of the famous dishes, corn ribs, mushroom parfait, cod‚Äôs head and they were all excellent.
A very decent wine list and good cocktails to get things going."
Fallow,5.0,"Went to Fallow twice recently. Was very happy both times. Food was great, service was excellent & atmosphere pretty good as a whole. I was particularly impressed with their head to tail choice of ingredients. Mindful some may find part of the menu too adventurous, it will surely satisfy those who are more used to a greater choice of ingredients or who are open to something more exotic or different. The best dishes in my first visit were Cod‚Äôs Head, mushroom parfait & corn ribs. I also like octopus crumpet & beef tartare. The only dish I found not as good as some I had tried before was possibly beef ribs. Second time I tried their roasted pig‚Äôs head. It was quite an experience. We were very impressed with the way how this pretty unthinkable giant of a dish was executed, served & tasted. I do have to give a warning though the dish is pretty fatty & filling. It will be a good idea to share it amongst at least 4 people if not six."
Fallow,5.0,Really good lunch on a Sunday. We had the roast beef with a side of cauliflower and broccoli cheese which was awesome. The cod‚Äôs head lived up to all expectations and I‚Äôd highly recommend. Chips on the side to mop up all the amazing sauce was a win. We were super full at the end but the sweetcorn ice cream was too good to say no to. Definitely retuning here.
Fallow,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant restaurant, would highly recommend.

We had the beef ribs, corn ribs and cod‚Äôs head with fries. The corn ribs were outstanding and the beef ribs were excellent. The cod‚Äôs head was very good also especially with the addition of the fries, though it does take 5-10 minutes to get over the fact that it is, in fact, a big cod‚Äôs head on your plate!

Our server Josh C was polite, attentive and helpful with menu suggestions and we enjoyed a brief chat at the end of the meal about Fallow and the sister restaurants, Fowl and Roe, Which are next on my list to visit!

They were also kind enough to provide us with a complementary dessert to share in celebration of our anniversary, which was very much appreciated."
Fallow,5.0,"Literally the best restaurant experience I have had. The staff were very attentive to the point where they were topping up our water and changing the empty bottles without us noticing.

The food was spectacular. Every element was perfectly balanced and looked beautiful! The hardest part was seeing diners order other dishes and having food envy. Out of everything I tried the Chelsea tart really stole the show.

I will definitely be back again!"
Fallow,5.0,"Tried Fallow for the first time and got the Corn ribs, mushroom parfait and cod head. All three were very good but my favourite has to be the mushroom parfait. I also recommend sitting at the kitchen bar as it was very entertaining watching the team operate in such as fast paced environment. Special shout out to Isabella who was my server for the night. She provided excellent recommendations and went above and beyond in terms of the level of care. Thanks to the entire team for a great first dinner in London!"
Fallow,5.0,"Visited here by myself spontaneously for my birthday without booking, was bit busy but luckily got the bar seat which is good for the solo diner.
The corn rib was a bit tricky to eat well but i loved the seasoning and steak was very soft and tasty. And also i got the Tomato Salad and it was really good with the cheese and crunchy something.
Server named Jack was very friendly and all the other servers were so nice and caring any inconvenience or how the food is, and i loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. Of course it‚Äôs in central London so was but pricy but recommended to spend your day on special occasion."
Fallow,5.0,"Excellent service, innovative dishes and cocktails, always lovely coming here and I don't think there's anything on the menu that I wouldn't try/haven't tried that was less than amazing. Took my mum a few days ago, and even though she normally neither drinks cocktails nor eats anything smoked, she loved her rhubarb spritz and was sorely tempted to lick the plate of her ribs clean.  I love that everything is so well thought through and rounded, and that there are so many small dishes to share, because, truly, you just want to try everything from this spectacular menu. Big shout out to the amazing waiters and waitresses as well, who are all very lovely and attentive! Always a good and special night out!"
Fallow,5.0,"This was such a superb restaurant, our waiter, Thomas, gave us excellent recommendations from the very beginning and provided us with top tier service throughout the evening. The food was excellent, there was not a single dish we had anything but praise for! The corn ribs and mushroom parfait are both must have dishes. Sitting at the chefs counter was incredibly fun, getting to watch your food being made and seeing the energy of the kitchen made for a really cool atmosphere that you only get by having the kitchen be ‚Äúcentre stage‚Äù in the restaurant space."
Fallow,5.0,"Stellar experience overall from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. Each staff member we interacted with was lovely and so attentive. Our server Tomos, did an excellent job reviewing our selections and ensuring we had the perfect amount of food for our group of 7 adults and one child. Wine and water were frequently filled, plates were cleared and exchanged as soon as needed. This is a family style service so I think it‚Äôs best enjoyed in a group to get to experience as much as possible. I also want to call out the exceptional service at the front desk. We ordered around 5 starter/small plates and three entrees and two sides and shared the sweet corn dessert. Mushroom parfait, sourdough bread, burrata, short ribs, duck pancake; cod‚Äôs head, tandoori cauliflower, rib eye, potatoes and cabbage; cocktails and wine; sweet corn soft serve. Our server heavily recommended the mushroom parfait and the person who doesn‚Äôt like mushrooms in the group even agreed it was fantastic. I think my overall favorite was the duck pancake. Absolutely fantastic and a brilliant experience."
Fallow,5.0,"Visited Fallow for dinner to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary. The food was unreal. Best bites were: corn ribs, mushroom parfait, and the fallow burger. Akira was a friendly, attentive and professional server. Our table was great too, right by the window for some good people-watching on Haymarket. Highly recommended for a delicious and indulgent meal."
Fallow,4.0,"Great attentive service, starters came out super quick. Kitchen bar seats were a great view. Non alcoholic cocktails were delicious.

Corn ribs 8/10 yummy but something I could easily recreate at home

Mushroom parfait 8.5/10. Lovely flavour, great bread

Beef ribs 9/10 lovely BBQ char flavour, fall off the bone tender

Chicken roast 8/10 huge portion of meat. Enough for 2 people. Potatoes nice and crispy, side veg were all very good. Nice savory gravy

Cods head, 7.5/10 fish was very fresh and cooked well but needed more seasoning, sauce was a bit one note and got a bit boring. Needed more of a kick. Lots of meat on the head.

Chips 8/10 same flavouring as the corn, nice and crispy

Salted corn soft serve 9/10 lovely balance of sweet, savory crunchy.

All very good generous sized portions"
Fallow,5.0,"The food was straight way amazing. One of the best things I have had in a while. The corn rips are a perfect start, the mushroom parfait is so rich in flavor and the miso eggplant really just super delicious. As a dessert I can really recommend the sweet corn - heaven!"
Fallow,5.0,"We had a great dinner at Fallow last week before our theater show. Shout out to our server Toby who was attentive, knowledgeable, and helped us pick out some really tasty dishes. The vibes are great for a date or with a group of friends. Everything tasted great - highlights were the rhubarb cocktail, mushroom toast (divine!), and cod head with chips. Would definitely return!"
Fallow,5.0,"Great ambience! Great food! My husband follows their YouTube channel and we wanted to visit on our trip to London!

The corn ribs are a must order! Beef short ribs were delicious! Everything was cooked to perfection
Sweet corn brown butter soft serve was also exceptional !

Want to go back to try their cod‚Äôs head

Staff was also friendly, reservations are really recommended as they get busy !"
Fallow,5.0,"I booked a seat for one and was placed at the bar, where I loved the vibes. The staff were incredibly nice, and the service was exceptional. Every dish I tried was delightful!

The mushroom parfait was surprisingly good, and the crispy corn seasoning was delicious. The ribs were tender and juicy, and the sauce elevated them to another level. Lastly, the beef fillet was one of the best I've had, complemented perfectly by the accompanying sauces."
Fallow,5.0,"Our waiter was super friendly, and we absolutely loved everything we ordered!
We highly recommend the beef ribs and the corn rice dessert. Outstanding! The ribs were super savory and juicy while the dessert was creamy and tasty.
There was a small band that came and sang to us for a while: it was lovely!
It's not a cheap place, but it is worth it!!
Super recommendable place"
Fallow,5.0,"What a great experience. After watching a number of YouTube  reviews over the past few months, we had high expectations, these were not only met but exceeded. We were here for a Sunday lunch, from the very moment we entered the service was professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The cocktails were incredible especially the gin rhubarb one.

We had the corn ribs and beef ribs as a starter, the amount of flavour in both was incredible.

The Sunday roast was the best I have had,  the beef had so much flavour, complimented by the perfectly cooked vegetables.

We do not normally have desert, however shared the rhubarb and ginger cheesecake, again incredible combinations of flavour.

Overall a great experience of high quality food, in a relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely be back, next time we are in London.

A big thanks to all the staff."
Fallow,2.0,"For the tourists: This place is a disappointment. It's overhyped and the reviews are flooded by locals who raise the overall score of the restaurant. Please do not visit.

Food:
The execution is really not good. This is despite all the social media hype, all the technique they showcase. The beef ribs lack body, the potato waffle cheese sauce lacks body as well and has this slight bitterness which wasn't good. The mushroom parfait was absolutely delicious, it's got great depth of flavour and complexity. Apparently it's a 3-4day process and it shows, the bread was good too.

The fallow burger was sad. Despite the nduja, the overall burger tastes so bland. The pickles were so mild, and the candied bacon was terrible.

Chelsea tart was good, however the milk ice cream was too mild. And the tart was too salty

Service: they were very annoyed with us ordering a few dishes at once, but they mentioned from the start that the food comes as and when. It's very confusing why they have a problem with it and they keep telling us it slows down the kitchen, which made no sense when they're not a fine dining place that has to ensure everything coming at once. They keep harping on it without properly explaining why. There was one nice lady who was in charge of us though

Atmosphere: Very packed and rowdy and tight place"
Fallow,5.0,"We had a wonderful experience at Fallow. This was my second time in London, first time at this restaurant and our waiter Tomos made us feel very welcome and right at home. He was super friendly and thoughtful. We even received a small anniversary dessert. The food was great, every dish was unique and delicious in its own way. We would recommend dining at the chef‚Äôs counter but you‚Äôll need to make a reservation. The staff in the kitchen were extremely hard working and professional.  A well oiled machine with an eye for detail and hygiene. It was a great evening ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you Fallow staff!"
Fallow,5.0,"After watching YouTube videos from Fallow for months, when I had a trip to London planned I could not have been more excited. I walked in with high expectations and they were all met or  exceeded.

The service was some of the best I had ever had. Every item of food that hit our table was excellent. Both the corn and beef ribs were delicious...the corn in a way I couldn't have expected. The tartare and mushrooms were great. Even my kids dinner were wonderful. And the desserts...its tough to know what to say. The caramelized whey tart is not something I'm easily able to describe. Think a pie filled with caramel, but not as heavy and with an amazing texture. The brown butter ice cream changed the way I envision the possibilities of ice cream.

I cannot recommend Fallow highly enough. We've even considered a return trip to London simply for a show and dinner here."
Fallow,4.0,"We tried the corn ribs, beef ribs, mushroom parfait, cod head, Rhubarb & Custard cocktail, and Mandarin Mimosa cocktail. The mushroom parfait was our absolute favourite‚Äîrich and full of flavour! The corn ribs were also delicious. The cod head was definitely an interesting dish, but well worth trying.

A big thank you to Anna, who served our table‚Äîshe was thoughtful, attentive, and gave us excellent food recommendations throughout the meal."
Fallow,5.0,Fallow is amazing. Retirement and anniversary breakfast celebration did not disappoint! Service was very attentive from the minute you walked in. Set at the chef‚Äôs table which was entertaining and intriguing. Breakfast croissant was so tasty and put together beautifully. Hash browns were crispy and fluffy all in the same bite. Restaurant was spotless and it is obvious to see why Fallow has such a good reputation. Would like to return for lunch on another visit.
Fallow,5.0,"Really wonderful restaurant. So happy I decided to pop in for early dinner. They accommodated me even though I was without reservation and dining alone. I gotta say my server Josh C. Had some amazing recommendations, the mushroom mousse was a must try! Thanks for that one! The duck pancake was my fav for sure. Really amazing and the staff were very genuine and seemed to love the work. If you can check it out, you MUST!"
Fallow,5.0,"Very tasty food with bar seating at Fallow on a Sunday eve. Jack, our waiter, went above and beyond to recommend his favorite dishes and we even got some compliments from the kitchen and bar staff, which was very unexpected and kind. Recommend for some British bites from a kitchen and bar staff that has craftsmanship."
Fallow,5.0,"I just had one of the most incredible dining experiences in London! Every moment was a delight, thanks to the amazing food and top-notch service. Our wonderful server, Amanda, was an absolute gem, and the fantastic manager Josh, along with Rommel and sommelier Priyance, truly outdid themselves to make our meal unforgettable. They went above and beyond, especially for one of us, ensuring we felt extra special. I had such a fantastic time ‚Äì I can't wait to return the next time I'm in London!"
Fallow,5.0,"Had the opportunity to visit London for a work trip and was looking forward to dining here as a lone diner, having followed the very informative and entertaining YouTube channel for a while. Was pretty jetlagged after a long journey from Australia but managed to get a booking for a seat at the Chef's counter on a busy Wednesday evening last week. Highly recommend the experience. Food was excellent, service was attentive and expeditious. Mushroom parfait was a highlight. It was a privelege being seated right adjacent the chef's pass and watching the kitchen team work together with great speed, skill, cohesion and chemistry. It was a very busy service just after 6PM and it was a pleasure watching the head chef lead the service seamlessly with great calmness and efficiency - the communication, camaraderie, and above all, palpable joy with which the team worked was reflected in the atmosphere of the place and the quality of the dishes served. A most memorable experience and one I would hope to repeat again in the future."
Fallow,5.0,"Absolutely love Fallow!
The food is incredible‚Äîdelicious, creative, and full of surprises. They make amazing dishes using parts of ingredients that most people usually discard, and the results are impressive.
I highly recommend sitting at the chef‚Äôs counter‚Äîit‚Äôs like dinner and a show, watching the chefs in action.
Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
Fallow,5.0,"Fallow, Fallow, Fallow.. You just got everything right! From the second I walked in, I was in heaven. The staff was so friendly, full of energy, and informative. I was served by Josh and he was awesome. I felt like it was a personal experience. The food, oh my goodness. Every dish and drink I had was incredible. So well thought of and creative. All the flavors just hit and the time/effort that goes into creating these is felt. Every first bite of each dish was a wow moment for me. I encourage you to watch the videos on their Instagram and see how the dishes are created! To top it all off, this place is sustainable. From growing their own mushrooms there to repurposing their oyster shells, they make that effort to be a sustainable establishment. I left with a huge smile on my face and I cannot wait to visit again for another Fallow experience."
Fallow,5.0,"I absolutely loved the corn ribs, mushroom parfait, cod head, beef burger and Sunday roast of roasted pork. The Dragon Punch for non-alcoholic drinkers is refreshing. All yummy! üòç and we were served by Ana who was most courteous and friendly, we loved her smile üòä"
Fallow,5.0,"We sat at the Chef's Counter overlooking the kitchen which kept us entertained, and in awe, watching the chefs create mouth watering dishes. The service was exceptional and our waiter Toby was attentive, charming and knowledgeable on both the food and wine. They also surprised us with dessert for our anniversary which was very special. My favourite dish was the burrata and my husband's was the cod's head. We can't wait to visit again."
Fallow,5.0,"Had a wonderful experience while celebrating our anniversary here. The service was friendly and all staff were incredibly welcoming. The sparkler was a nice touch! The food was good but not outstanding; the salmon croissant roll was tasty but nothing memorable, the mushroom toast was very flavourful, thanks to the wild garlic pesto, though the broccoli on it felt a bit out of place. My favorite was the blueberry cake with poppyseed crumble which was delicious. Would definitely be coming back to try lunch/dinner."
Fallow,5.0,4 people - we ordered 15 food items and some drinks. EVERYTHING was amazing! Seasoned to limit but not over. Outstanding cooking techniques. Crazy good service. Best restaurant without a star I have ever been. Absolutely worth going there!!!
Fallow,3.0,"While most of the food was exceptionally good, the burgers were remarkably dull, 2/5, buns weren't great, meat was dry, you can get a MUCH better burger from Five Guys/Honest Burger. Just avoid the burgers and you'll be fine.
Overall, great food, excellent drinks, but average value for money. The service was very good."
Fallow,4.0,"The food at Fallow Restaurant was very good. Highlights included the corn ribs and the black cod head, which were amazing. However, the service lacked attention and forgot the birthday celebration."
Fallow,5.0,"Just had the most amazing Sunday lunch!  Seriously, everything was perfect.  Started with the corn ribs and duck pancakes, which were both incredible. Then we went for the full roast and wow, just wow. So much delicious food, perfectly cooked. Definitely going back for more soon. Highly recommend checking this place out if you can! Best Sunday lunch I've had in ages.

It was my birthday and they even brought out a sparkler with the desserts"
Fallow,5.0,"Faultless food and perfect service - thank you Aston for the excellent explanations and guidance! We were a party of 3 and shared the mushroom parfait, beef ribs (we had two portions), octopus muffin, corn ribs, aubergine, tomato salad and sourdough bread. Standouts were the mushroom parfait and the aubergine - just stunning. We thought it couldn't get better and then we shared the Rhubarb mousse and Chelsea Tart - unanimously, the two best desserts we had ever had. I will be dreaming about the food and looking forward to my next visit."
Fallow,5.0,"Second time coming to Fallow, this time for mine and my boyfriend‚Äôs 2 year anniversary. He‚Äôs been a few times and is absolutely in love with the place, as am I! We were served by Manisha who was attentive, friendly and gave us two drinks on the house, and made us feel really looked after. She made the evening! All the food was gorgeous - Jack was in the kitchen, and we were lucky enough to meet and thank him, he was really friendly and down to earth. The whole kitchen and service team are brilliant. Truly amazing. I‚Äôll always come back to Fallow!"
Fallow,5.0,"Incredible food that lives up to the hype, the mushroom parfait is delicious. What really made this a special experience however was the service from Vivian - genuinely the kindest, warmest service we have EVER had. She was so charismatic and made our anniversary lunch so memorable. Give that girl a raise x"
Fallow,5.0,"Great food and staff. The corn ribs were definitely special. The oysters are served with delicious shallots and their special sriracha which was fire. The mushroom parfait was really rich. The duck pancake was really great too. Finally, the burger was really rich and beefy. I would say it is not for everyone as the intense beef flavor can be overwhelming for some but for me it was perfect. The desert of Chelsea Tart was bomb!

Our waiter, Gabriel, was excellent. Very attentive and friendly."
Fallow,5.0,Booked for dinner with family. What an amazing experience. Akira did a great job with menu suggestions and was very attentive. Had pig's head!! Unforgettable. definitely return.
Fallow,5.0,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday treat. We sat at the 'Chefs Counter' - something I highly recommend you do. You will get to see the chefs working in full swing up close.

The dishes were all spectacular. Our favourites were the Scallop Ceviche and the Tandoori cauliflower. You should not leave without trying the corn ribs.

The wine list catered to a wide range of budgets.

The desserts were fantastic. I can strongly recommend you try the Chelsea tart - it was smooth and creamy.

To round it all off, we had Espresso Martinis, which was by quite far the best one I've ever had.

I will be back. I'm eyeing the cod's head, and the pig's head.

Only loses the point off atmosphere as it was slightly too loud for me."
Fallow,5.0,"We had a fantastic final meal in London at Fallow, made even more special by our amazing waiter Jack.

The food was outstanding‚Äîwe especially loved the corn ribs, ricotta, oysters, and the beef main plate. Every dish was creative and full of flavor.

At the end of our meal, Jack told us he‚Äôd pulled some strings and arranged a surprise: a move from our corner bar seats to the chef‚Äôs counter for a complimentary dessert and final fun experience for the night!

Jack was gracious, attentive, and truly went above and beyond. We‚Äôll be recommending Fallow to everyone we know for sure. Thanks for the perfect send-off!"
Fallow,5.0,"Went here for our anniversary dinner and it did not disappoint. We started with the beef ribs and the potato waffle both of which were amazing but the beef ribs fell off the bone and I would highly recommend.
For mains we had the Fallow burger and the Sandy Black Pork. Both dishes were easily some of the best we have had. At this point we were stuffed but out comes a bowl of soft serve ice creams with some caramel sauce and caramelised cornflakes and a sparkler to wish us a happy anniversary. This tasted so good and it was incredibly thoughtful of the team.
Our waiter Calvin was amazing.  Constantly refreshing our water. Clearing the table and just made our experience even better.
If you are even considering going to Fallow, let this be the reason you decide to go!"
Fallow,5.0,"Fabulous place - we arrived at 3 on a Friday afternoon and the restaurant was very busy and buzzing. David the Maitr'd was very welcoming and Troy our waiter was very knowledgeable and talked us through the dishes (I had no idea what Hen of the Wood was, or Pink Fur Potatoes for that matter.) Everything was delicious but our personal favourites were the ribs and the mushroom parfait. I had the cods head as the big dish, because I had never seen it on a menu before and like to try new dishes. Again it tasted amazing though if you're going all in I would recommend trying the eyeball first as it has a very unusual taste and the dish just gets better and better after that. Thanks also to Toby the sommelier for helping us pick out some lovely wines.
Oh and the fries were the absolute best I've ever tasted! Would love to know the recipe and try them at home."
Fallow,5.0,"I had an incredible dinner last night. I started with the gooseberry heat and the mushroom parfait, followed by the roasted miso aubergine and the rhubarb and custard spritz. I ended the meal with the British cheese board. I loved the inventive, delicious dishes and honestly had never imagined some of the flavors blending so well together. Rose was super attentive and all her recommendations were spot on! Thanks for a lovely evening."
Fallow,5.0,"Had the best Sunday roast at Fallow. The food was exceptional and what made our visit even better was their lovely bartender, Rosa, from Australia. She was so friendly and gracious and took the time to chat with us about living in London as I have just moved over from NZ. She even made an espresso martini shot for us at the end of our dinner because I had mentioned I was tired from a long day. Thank you, Rosa!!"
Fallow,5.0,"Fallow serves up fantastic food, with plenty of exciting dishes on the menu. I‚Äôd recommend skipping the burger ‚Äì I tried it and regretted it only because there were so many other more interesting options, and the burger itself wasn‚Äôt anything special.

The menu is designed for sharing, and I‚Äôd suggest ordering 2‚Äì4 small plates (plus sides get some veg in you) and 2 mains for a satisfying meal. Every other dish we tried was delicious and well worth it.

The dress code is relaxed ‚Äì casual is perfectly fine, and we didn‚Äôt feel out of place.

The staff were excellent, and our server, Amanda, was especially lovely, making the whole experience even better."
Fallow,5.0,"Had a great time here with my friends. The food is great and so do the cocktails. We love the mushroom parfait so much! It is definitely a mush have here. The waiter Josh C. was so helpful as well. Friendly reminder, do you reservation before you come."
Fallow,5.0,"We sat out on the terrace, which was lovely overall ‚Äì although there was a faint, odd odor that came and went, it wasn‚Äôt enough to spoil the experience. My partner had the beef Sunday roast and absolutely loved it. The potatoes were perfectly crispy, and the beef was cooked just right (always a gamble with roasts, but they nailed it here).  I, however, met my new obsession: the spicy tandoori cauliflower. Bold, smoky, and packed with flavor ‚Äì I‚Äôd come back just for that. 10/10 would recommend."
Fallow,5.0,"It was our first time here and we couldn‚Äôt decide if we wanted to have their set lunch or order a bunch of small eats.
Thank god for Alvin, we ordered one set lunch and a bunch of dishes to share and all of his recommendation were 10/10!
The beef ribs WERE INCREDIBLE and the mushroom parfait was so well balanced!"
Fallow,5.0,"Exceptional experience, Ive vyed after eating at Fallow for a long time, and the experience did not fall short whatsoever. Our host Anna was extremely attentive, informative and knowledgeable on drink pairings and answered all of our questions with ease.

Our intolerant guest was catered for to a T and our entire meal was sublime. You will not regret any meal at Fallow, please go if you have been meaning to!

Thank you to all the staff for a fabulous experience, I cannot wait to come back üòª"
Fallow,5.0,"The service was absolutely amazing, our waiter was so helpful with answering our queries and they were able to substitute items we couldn‚Äôt eat. We had the beef short rib, fillet and burger- all were great but the short rib and the sauce on the fillet were the best parts. Fries were also amazing. We came for a birthday and they provided some soft serve for us to share. Bill was around ¬£103 which is quite steep but good place to go for a special occasion"
Fallow,5.0,"I discovered this restaurant through their YouTube channel as I love watching their chef‚Äôs cooking demonstrations. I‚Äôve became mildly obsessed, and the day I arrived in London. I dropped my bag at the hotel and went straight here for lunch.

ÔøºWithout a reservation I only had a short wait, but I would advise booking in advance as it is no secret, how wonderful this place is.

I sat at the bar but I would recommend sitting at the chef counter, so you can watch all the activity in the kitchen. They also have outdoor seating which is covered and on the side street so still sunny and off the main drag.

The greatest challenge with dining solo is that you have to manage how much you order. Trying to be conservative I started with the Duck pancake, and I swear I could‚Äôve eaten six of these. They are so delicious light and fantastic. Ôøº

For my main, I ordered the Sandy black pork, which was juicy and sweet. I pretty much clean the plate and in an effort to get a little vegetable in my belly I ordered the Isle of White tomato salad.

Because I meal like this requires wine, I started with an Alvari√±o, and then shifted to a red selection from Greece, that was made by the bartender. I‚Äôm glad I tried the Greek wine, but I still stand firm in my opinion about Greek wines. Ôøº

If you were reading this review, and considering going I highly recommend it. I would suggest coming with friends, but she will still have a wonderful time, if dining alone."
Fallow,5.0,"Excellent food, and service. We had the tasting menu, and all of the dishes were extraordinary.
The service was very attentive. My food intolerances were met with alternatives, when communicated properly. One misunderstood regarding my food intolerance led to a free meal for my husband - which is, again, a sign of great service. The restaurant lives up to the hype. :)"
Fallow,5.0,"Worthy of its spot on the Michelin Guide and the best meal we had in London! JC was wonderful and gave us great recommendations. Here are some of my thoughts on the dishes we tried.

Mushroom parfait: I could have eaten so much more of this. Smooth, with an umami flavour and a subtle sweetness. Probably our favourite dish.

Burrata with chilli oil: An unusual combination, but we were pleasantly surprised by how good it was! The mild, creamy flavour and texture of the burrata really complemented the distinct flavour and crunchiness of the crispy chili oil.

Bavette steak: Tender pieces of steak served with buttery tallow and an extremely rich, flavourful sauce.

Sweet corn with brown butter soft serve: The only thing I wasn‚Äôt completely crazy about, but that's really just a personal preference. Brown butter is a very mild flavour for ice cream and it just wasn't my cup of tea.

Chelsea tart: Every bite is of the most decadent caramel tart. It has a very slight bitterness that helps to balance the sweetness perfectly. We loved this one."
Fallow,5.0,"came here for a solo birthday dinner and the staff‚Äôs hospitality is top notch! had the oyster martini, mushroom parfait and cod head, ending off with the soft serve dessert. am full of good food by the end of the meal. such a great time. would like to come back and try the mussels next!"
Fallow,5.0,"We had an early pre-theatre dinner here at Fallow on Haymarket, and it was wonderful.  We ordered from the set menu with a couple of extra dishes on the side.

As extras to the set menu we ordered the beef short ribs and corn ribs as a little appetiser. The ribs were beautiful, the meat was flavoursome and so tender it just fell off the bone.  The corn ribs were something I'd not had before, I don't what the seasoning on them was but they were really tasty (I could have happily had just a glass of wine and a big dish of these!)

For our starters we ordered the burrata with caramelised onions and chilli and the mushroom parfait.  We ordered a portion of bread and butter to go with the starters but in hindsight this was a bit ambitious as the portion sizes were generous and I felt we didn't do the delicious crusty, warm bread justice.  The burrata was excellent quality, and worked really well with the onions and chilli.  The mushroom parfait was light and savoury, and served with generous amount of grilled bread.

For our mains we had the rolled lamb shoulder and the flamed mussels.  The lamb was tender and nicely cooked, served with crushed peas.  The mussels were cooked in a sriracha sauce, again, a generous portion.  I've not had mussels cooked in this kind of sauce before and they were absolutely delicious, there was a bread cro√ªte at the bottom of the dish which was an excellent way to soak up the last of the wonderful sauce (I may have used a spoon too...)

My friend chose the polenta cake with peach comp√¥te for her dessert and I opted for the sweetcorn and brown butter ice cream with smoked caramel.  I was curious as to how sweetcorn would work in a dessert and didn't quite know what to expect.  It was prepared almost like cornflakes and coated in a sweet crunchy caramel.  The ice cream was lovely too, I couldn't really taste anything smoky about the caramel but that might just be me.  The polenta cake was soaked in a syrup and the comp√¥te fresh and light.  We shared our desserts and polenta cake worked especially well with the ice cream.

The set menu is served until 5pm and is ¬£42 for 3 courses."
Fallow,4.0,"My feelings are mixed but leaning positive >

The service is phenomenal and it doesn‚Äôt seem forced. The staff seem to genuinely care and act like people, not machines programmed to serve which is a good representation of how the company treats them. Makes you feel happy.

The food is overall good and solely depends on personal preference. I came specifically for the corn ribs I‚Äôve heard much about. MUST GET!! I practically vacuumed them off the plate!! The portobello mushroom burger was nostalgic and exquisite ! Reminded me of my teenage years in Notting Hill. And all the desserts lived up to expectation.

The only negative I have was regarding the burrata- the seasoning tasted foul to both our taste buds, but hey I‚Äôm not an avid food connoisseur so what do we know. To your average person it tasted a little too salty and way too overstimulating.

They provided me a charger and it saved my life ! They take very good care of you"
Fallow,4.0,"We had a fabulous date night at Fallow. Four stars as I felt the price didn't quite match the food. Everything was packed full of flavour, perhaps even too much in some cases where I felt the flavour overpowered the produce (e.g. mussels).

We ordered the corn ribs, beef ribs, mushroom parfait, mussels, burger, ice cream and Chelsea tart. No regrets on what we ordered, but standouts were the mushroom parfait and the two desserts."
Fallow,4.0,"The food was delicious, but I didn't really like how the tables are laid out, as it felt like we were sat in a busy corridor with people brushing past constantly. Navigating a path to the bathrooms was also tricky. The service was very good but it would have been nice if the staff could have proactively made some suggestions on drinks pairings. I enjoyed it but I don't think I'd go back."
Fallow,5.0,Excellent visit asked for the discretionary charged to be removed. I prefer to tip in cash in London only higher denomination note I had was üí∂ so used that.  A visit I will repeat once again.  Perhaps one of the other sister restaurants.
Fallow,4.0,"This place truly shines when it comes to its small plates ‚Äî the Mushroom Parfait was so incredible we ended up ordering four of them, and the Corn Ribs were so addictive we had to get a second round. While the main dishes didn‚Äôt quite impress us the same way, the overall experience was still enjoyable. The ambiance is gorgeous and thoughtfully designed, making it a perfect spot for a laid-back yet stylish gathering. The staff were attentive, kind, and made us feel very welcome. A beautiful space with standout bites worth coming back for."
Fallow,5.0,Roast was delicious - best potato‚Äôs and gravy I‚Äôve had with a roast. Our server Ana was so kind and made the experience even better. I would really recommend here for the roast! Only negative I found was that my rump was slightly undercooked
Fallow,5.0,"One of the best restaurants in London and highly worth a trip. Everything about Fallow is great from their ethos around sustainable, local and seasoning cooking to the sites he hot sauce which you can buy (delicious). The food its self is delicious. Highly recommend the mushroom parfait, any of the burgers and beef ribs. Also don‚Äôt forget to save space for the deserts! The service is very attentive and the waiters are happy to answer any questions you have about the menu. If you are in London are looking for a restaurant with amazing food, atmosphere and decor then Fallow is the place to be."
Fallow,5.0,"Our time at Fallow was a good one, mainly because we were served by Alvin who was attentive and approachable providing good service. He also gave us a free dessert to celebrate our anniversary, which was very thoughtful of him and the restaurant.

We ordered corn ribs, duck pancake, mushroom parfait and cod head.

Standout dish was the mushroom parfait. Earthy and slightly sweet, great starter. The cod head was fun to dissect (revealed a lot more meat than expected), but you must have the patience to do so.

The prices are on the higher side, but that is expected with the level of skill and service provided. The vibe of the entire restaurant was also very inviting and lively, which makes it a great hangout spot."
Fallow,5.0,"Hip and vibrant, this restaurant delivers a modern take on British cuisine in a lively, buzzing atmosphere. It was absolutely packed on a Thursday night, so reservations are a must.

The concept is sharing plates, and every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and beautifully plated. The corn rib was the perfect start- crisp, salty, and seasoned with kombu to awaken the taste buds. The smoked beef ribs were another standout: fall-apart tender and glazed with a rich, flavorful sauce. Vegetarian options shone as well - the roasted miso aubergine and harissa cauliflower were incredible, layered with umami and topped with crunchy textures.

On our server‚Äôs recommendation, we finished with the Chelsea tart, and it did not disappoint. The custard was luxuriously smooth and slightly salty, perfectly balanced by the mild milk ice cream - a flawless end to the meal.

Service was warm, attentive, and highly accommodating. Overall, a must-visit for exceptional food, interesting plating, and an electric atmosphere."
Fallow,5.0,"It's a lovely cheat, as a warm welcome primes you to look for more things to appreciate. Impeccable service.
The parfait and beef ribs were out of this world.
The corn ribs were lovely, in particular with the lime juice.
The cod head was tasty, admittedly not living up to the rest but still absolutely no regrets.
A memorable experience living up to the YouTube hype."
Fallow,5.0,"If you‚Äôre in London and want a dining experience that blends creativity, bold flavors, and genuine hospitality ‚Äì FALLOW is an absolute must!

The Mushroom Parfait is silky and rich, the Smoked Beef Ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender with deep smoky notes, and the Burger is pure perfection ‚Äì juicy, flavorful, and served in a perfectly toasted bun. For something truly unique, try the Beef Tartare & Oysters ‚Äì a daring yet perfect combination of fresh brininess and rich beef.

But the star that sets FALLOW apart is their Smoked Cod‚Äôs Head ‚Äì beautifully presented, delicately smoked, and packed with flavor that will completely change the way you think about fish. It‚Äôs an absolute showstopper.

On top of all this, the staff make the experience unforgettable ‚Äì warm, attentive, and genuinely passionate about what they do. You‚Äôre not just having a meal here, you‚Äôre creating a memory.

Book ahead ‚Äì this is one of those places you‚Äôll want to revisit again."
Fallow,5.0,"One of the top 10 meals I‚Äôve ever eaten. Everything was immaculate from the service on down to the presentation. I let the chef choose my dinner which started out with the street corn, then mushroom p√¢t√©, which was possibly one of the best things I‚Äôve ever eaten. Next, I had the beef rib and the fried potato waffle. Finishing up the dinner with an incredible burger and fries. The sweet corn soft serve was a perfect dessert which was not too sweet, but had an incredible combination of textures. I know they‚Äôre listed in the Michelin guide, but in my opinion, they deserve a star."
Fallow,5.0,"Great experience, all staff interactions were friendly, professional, and full of personality. Erick, my server, went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect. The food was excellent, and eating facing the kitchen pure theatre. Would recommend for any occasion with plenty of choice to suit."
Fallow,5.0,"We had a great time during our visit. Both the food and service were perfect from start to finish. I had really high expectations from following the restaurant on YouTube, recommendations from people like Ben at Sorted Food and your socials. All these expectations were exceeded.

Highly recommend the corn ribs, Sunday roast and the Chelsea tart.

Thanks a lot for a great meal"
Fallow,5.0,"The staff were super friendly and helpful with food recommendations, which made the experience feel welcoming right from the start. Service was impressively fast ‚Äî the dishes came out quickly without feeling rushed.

The mussels were a real highlight: fresh, tender, and swimming in a rich, buttery sauce that was perfect for dipping. Honestly, I‚Äôd go back just for that.
The corn ribs made for a fun, crunchy starter, and the beetroot salad was a surprisingly strong contender too ‚Äî the crispy seaweed on top added this brilliant textural contrast that made the dish pop.

The burger was a heavy-hitter: juicy, flavorful, and the blue cheese brought just the right amount of punch without overpowering the beef. Properly done.

The only miss? The drinks. Way too sweet ‚Äî like someone dropped a packet of candy into a cocktail shaker. Not a dealbreaker, but next time I‚Äôd probably skip them and stick to the food."
Fallow,5.0,"We had a great experience for dinner. The staff was very friendly! We got the ribeye and it was delicious, as well as the corn ribs. Some portion sizes were a bit small, but all of the food tasted great. They had warmers and blankets for outdoor seating as well.
Only downside is for the steaks, you do have to get a very large portion to share, they don't really have individual portions depending on the day."
Fallow,5.0,"Lunch at Fallow on Haymarket.

Really not sure why we haven‚Äôt been here before, however this place is awesome.

Fantastic food, some original dishes, all full of flavour. Couldn‚Äôt pick a favourite, all were consistently excellent.

Busy, buzzy, complimented with top, friendly service, with Joyce looking after us well. Sitting at the counter is the way to go.

Love their sustainability ethos too. With a set lunch menu of ¬£42 a head, this ticks all the boxes. Definitely worth a look.

Loved it. We will be back again soon, that‚Äôs for sure."
Scully,4.0,"Scully in St. James‚Äôs delivers one of the most exciting dining experiences in London. Every dish bursts with bold, unexpected flavours‚Äîthink rich spices, clever pickling, and perfect balance. The open kitchen and shelves of colourful ferments set the tone, while the service is warm and knowledgeable.

From bold welcome snacks like spiced chickpeas and tendon crackers with oyster cream to vegetable-driven stars like forbidden rice or a delicate tomato-strawberry-coconut salad, every dish feels thoughtful yet off-beat

A true gem for adventurous food lovers."
Scully,5.0,Had a truly fabulous meal here last night. It is truly impressive how such unusual ingredients are blended to create such exceptional flavours. I also love the relaxed atmosphere. Our favourite main was the hogget. Just wow.  My friend‚Äôs 13 year old son hoovered EVERYTHING up. I think that says it all! Well done team!!
Scully,4.0,"Scully, Chef Ramael Scully, born in Malaysia to a mother of Chinese and Indian heritage and an Irish-Balinese father. He grew up in Sydney. Chef Scully brings an array of international influences to his self-titled restaurant; from Malaysia to Sydney via India and China.
The dishes bursted with flavours but with the right balance. I also noticed extensive use of exotic vegetables within the dish itself.
The ambience is casual and relaxed. Service was friendly, attentive and professional."
Scully,5.0,Absolutely wonderful experience. Met with a friend for lunch and was looked after brilliantly by the front of house team. Wine - amazing. Food - amazing. Ambience - amazing! I definitely need to spend more time here ü§ô
Scully,5.0,"Really depends on what you order. The dishes I ordered are extremely delicious, but the ones my partner ordered are genuinely mediocre. The chicken leg is great! Pity that no tasting menu option for lunch."
Scully,5.0,"Exceptional on all fronts. For a reasonably early reservation we got an amazing spot, with a view of the whole restaurant. From start to finish, the whole experience was outstanding.

The food itself was head and shoulders above what you would experience at other tasting menus. The unique vegan menu, blew away the standard options you might get elsewhere. And the quality of every dish was indescribable. Overall, each dish was well balanced with ingredients and flavours. But the menu also had an excellent flow.

The wine complemented each dish and elevated all the flavours. A special thanks to Luis, who talked us through each pairing and shares our enthusiasm. 10/10"
Scully,5.0,"Not usually a fan of fusion cuisine, but each dish surpassed expectations - super simple lunch, great service and friendly head chef. Would love to try the tasting menu."
Scully,4.0,"I love the atmosphere and friendly service of this restaurant, dishes were served quickly but you have a lot of time to enjoy them.
The portions are very generous and they are of great taste if you enjoy flavours, though you might found some dishes a little bit heavy on the use of oil.
Generally it is a restaurant I would revisit with friends, especially given the relaxed environment, you can see their kitchen and service being really friendly."
Scully,5.0,"Great Tasting menu with interesting and wonderful food combinations. The wine pairing was well thought through and explored some wines you wouldn‚Äôt usually go for.

Service was the perfect balance of being friendly and informative while also being subtle and attentive"
Scully,5.0,"Scully St James‚Äôs truly has it all. Incredible food, atmosphere and service. Chef was incredibly kind to accommodate our late arrival and cook some amazingly flavorful dishes - highly recommend the tasting menu, but come hungry. We started with mushrooms, fried octopus and tomato salad. The sauces here deserve their own awards. Our starters and mains are shown in the pictures, and each was its own work of art in addition to be delicious.
The other standout? Luis and his fellow waitstaff. They didn‚Äôt make us feel rushed, offered suggestions and had great senses of humor.
What else could you ask for? Oh, excellent cocktail and wine list - check. We enjoyed their take on an old fashioned and elderflower gin fizz, followed by Georgian, Spanish and French wines/champagne.
Plan to spend two hours, enjoy the open kitchen and laid back feel. Cannot recommend more."
Scully,5.0,"What a wonderful experience. From start to finish everything was perfect. The hostess greeted us without even asking our names, then sat us in a nice area in the restaurant where we could see everything. The kitchen has an open concept, so it‚Äôs nice to see what they were doing without sitting at the counter. We were served our food at a nice pace and in enough time to catch our play at the theatre. Favourite dishes were the pork belly and spiced cake dessert. The aubergine was served cold, which would have been more complimentary warm or hot. The crispy rice cracker had a beautiful texture too."
Scully,4.0,"Overall the food was good. We had the lunch 3 course tasting menu. The starters we ordered were a miss for me personally. The pork belly with the anchovy sauce was a little too salty for my liking and th monkfish cheeks were just alright. The fish w pistachio sambal main eas a star though! The pastrami was decent as well. For dessert, we had the basil popping dish which was fantastic. Would definitely recommend. We did not really like the pineapple blueberry dessert. It was not very balanced, the blueberry compote was too overpowering. Would have done better with a vanilla or tonka bean cream or ice cream. The service was excellent though and we were offered the arepa and eggplant sambal on the house which was very good. Would recommend ordering that!"
Scully,5.0,"I had a fantastic time at Sculpt Restaurant. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was warm, stylish, and welcoming ‚Äì the perfect setting for a relaxed meal.

The food was absolutely spot on ‚Äì full of flavour, beautifully presented, and clearly made with care. Every dish felt thoughtfully crafted, and the quality really stood out.

The vibe of the place was just right too ‚Äì a great balance of lively yet laid-back, with music and lighting that added to the overall experience without being overbearing.

Highly recommend Sculpt for anyone looking for delicious food in a great setting. I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
Scully,5.0,". Great quality and portions. Everything was amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to go back again.
The kitchen staff looked happy and even when they were super busy the vibe was very good. I can‚Äôt say what I liked the most because everything I had was delicious.  were the best I ever had. Amazing food, service, and exceptional good cocktails"
Scully,3.0,"I had been wanting to go here for a long time, but saw a review a while ago that made me question the integrity of some of the reviews. But I finally bit the bullet and went tonight. Firstly, the service was great. But the food was disappointing for the price point.

Disclaimer - I‚Äôm vegetarian, but there are plenty of veggie dishes on the menu so I had high hopes. The aubergine starter was nice enough but nothing particularly special. And the forbidden rice felt like a bowl of rice with a few things sprinkled around the edges but it lacked a main element and a wow factor. I should also say that my wife really enjoyed the pork belly starter and her chicken main was nice, but again not exceptional. For almost ¬£200 for 2 with one drink each (only one alcoholic) we left feeling a lack of value for money. Hopefully the other reviews are genuine and we just ordered badly."
Scully,5.0,"I cannot rave about this place enough. The food was amazing, which I‚Äôd heard anyway, but then the service and attentiveness was a whole other level. I was blown away by the kindness and care that went into customising so many dishes and even creating something off menu so I could enjoy a meal out with gestational diabetes AND it was done with such hospitality and grace, like it wasn‚Äôt even a problem let alone an inconvenience. I still can‚Äôt get over how incredible every single member of staff we spoke to and dealt with was, and how humble Scully was when we thanked him at the end. Such an amazing experience, I can‚Äôt wait to be back, and am so glad we discovered it to begin with. A real memorable experience, for both the quality and flavour of the food, but then also the hospitality and service, each within their own right. Thank you for such a lovely memorable evening; it was our first date night without kids in 3 years, but it was special and memorable more because of all the staff and their incredible attitude!"
Scully,5.0,I wanted to try a new restaurant so I done some exploring and found this place. The service was amazing really friendly and polite. The food came in good time and was very pleased with the service and the food quality. I would definitely recommend trying out this spot. I could not complain. Will be returning another time for more delicious food.
Scully,5.0,"This was my second visit but I hadn‚Äôt visited since 2018 when I had an excellent time. I‚Äôm happy to say it lived up to expectations again. The food was delicious and full of flavour. We opted for the 2 courses for ¬£60 but between the three of us, we got a different starter and main to share. As starters, we shared the arepa with eggplant sambal and labneh (loved the flavour and texture), monkfish cheeks (tasted like a deconstructed laksa) and crispy pork belly (good). For the mains, we shared the forbidden black rice (unique dish to Scully and had really interesting but tasty flavour), seabass (well cooked) and the beef cheek pastrami (this was melt in your mouth and so good) as mains. The portion sizes were generous which is uncommon at establishments like this so it was refreshing to see. The service was thorough, helpful and attentive."
Scully,5.0,"Absolutely phenomenal experience! From the impeccable service to the exquisite dishes, every detail was perfect. The flavors were rich, creative, and beautifully presented. Easily one of the best dining experiences I've ever had ‚Äî truly deserving of 5 stars!"
Scully,5.0,"Such a special restaurant with incredible food, great service from a welcoming team and a genuinely cool vibe. The flavours were enormous and soundtrack kept you chilled. I will be returning soon to check out the new season menu."
Scully,5.0,"Quickly became my favourite restaurant in London (and I am a foodie). I‚Äôve been to 1 and 2 Michelin stars, but to me nothing compares to the experience Scully provides. The richness of flavours, the details, the innovative approach, the portions, the fact you basically have a chef‚Äôs table experience and get to watch him working up closely throughout the whole dinner, it‚Äôs unmatchable. Never had a better wine flight either - the wine pairing with the arepa it‚Äôs unbelievably good. My brother in law is vegan and he said he was the best tasting menu he had too. And the chef is so approachable and nice! I could spend hours writing about the incredible alchemy is done in here, but I will just say: BOOK YOUR TABLE."
Scully,5.0,"The food here is EXCELLENT and I'll definitely be back.

The restaurant is smart but has a nice relaxed atmosphere with friendly & attentive staff. We went with the a la carte menu which we felt was good value given the quality of the food and including a glass of prosecco was a nice touch.

Every dish was outstanding - the enoki mushroom and watermelon 'snacks' were a highlight, and every dish that followed was delicious, with inspriation from so many parts of the world. Honestly can't wait to return and try all the dishes we didn't get to order. Well done Scully & team :)"
Scully,5.0,"I dined at Scully‚Äôs for my birthday and every minute of the experience was 11/10.

We sat by the bar and our two waiters Luis & Zaf were great fun and very attentive. Also, chef Scully was very social and kindly let us taste additional dishes as he was so passionate about the vegan tasting menu and introducing us to different dishes beyond the menu offering. We felt very spoilt and each dish was exceptional. As two foodies it is hard to blow us away, but genuinely this has to be the best meal I have ever eaten. My sister agrees! Thank you so much to the team for taking such good care of us and filling our bellies with sensational food. I have already booked to go back again and I only left an hour ago!

Cannot recommend enough."
Scully,5.0,"Nestled in the heart of the city, Scully is a culinary gem that offers a dining experience like no other. From the moment we stepped through the door, we were greeted by extremely welcoming staff.

Our evening at Scully began with a delightful array of appetizers that set the tone for what was to come. The Masala Chickpeas with Butternut Squash and Tahini were a burst of exotic flavors that danced on the palate, while the Salt & Pepper Shimeji Mushrooms with Yeast Vinaigrette provided a savory umami kick that left us craving more.

The Arepa topped with Eggplant Sambal and Bergamot Labneh was a true revelation, blending textures and tastes in a way that was both comforting and exciting. The BBQ Asparagus with Burned Butter Tzatziki and Datterino Cherry Tomatoes was a dish that celebrated the freshness of the ingredients, each bite bursting with summer flavors.

The Scallops with Friarielli and Green Peas were a highlight of the meal, perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. We also ordered the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.

To end our meal on a refreshing note, we savored a dish of melon, pimelo seeds, and alfonso mango that was a symphony of sweetness and tanginess, the perfect way to cleanse the palate and leave us feeling satisfied.

Overall, our experience at Scully was nothing short of exceptional. The creativity and skill of the chefs shone through in every dish, and the attentive service only added to the overall enjoyment of the evening. If you're looking for a dining experience that will both surprise and delight your taste buds, look no further than Scully."
Scully,5.0,"Our friends recommended this place and I book it on the evening of the day we arrived at London. Warm and friendly staffs, some took times to chat with us. I opted for the 2-course prix-fixed and my wife ordered an entree a-la-carte. The Crispy Pork Belly, Fish Caramel, Sweet-Heart Cabbage & Pomelo Slaw was mouth watering and brought me back to familiar childhood flavors (south Vietnam), the BBQ Onglet, Padron Peppers, Spring Onions, Jerusalem Artichokes, Taleggio was just as fantastic and the portion was perfect. My wife loved her Sea Bass, Baby Leeks, Pickled Mustard Greens, Tauco. We shared the Popping Candy Basil Pot, and the flavor exploded in each bite. Since we were the the only guests at the restaurant, we had photos taken with Chef Scully. What an honor to dine at this fabulous restaurant. Strongly recommended."
Scully,5.0,"Dear team and respected administration of the restaurant Scully!

I am pleased and looking forward to thanking you for a pleasant soulful evening in a warm atmosphere, amazing host servise & exquisite food.

Gratitude for the amazing history of the creation of the restaurant and the history of food through which the most pleasant administrator immersed us.

Many thanks to the chef Scully for his exquisite dishes and golden hands!

The best restaurant I have visited recently, the best fish I have eaten in London!

I can safely say that I will come more and more often, recommend it to all my friends and be sure to inspire my subscribers with my stories and snaps from this restaurant.

Sincerely, Svyatoslav ! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Scully,5.0,"""We found the eating experience unique in offering shared portions and innovative food combinations. The staff were incredibly well informed and able to give in-depth detail which made our tasting explorative and stimulating. We will definitely
be back soon, thank you."""
Scully,4.0,"Food 8/10
Mochi Dumpling: LOVE. Absolutely a must get. It was not shaped the way that I was expecting, but it was super flavorful and textured, in a pleasantly surprising way. The combination of ingredients really blew me away.
Arepas: Yummy but quite small, and I even liked the eggplant dip, even though I usually dislike thta vegetable.
Crisped Pork Belly: Could be passed on, it was a little cold and too fatty without enough crisp.
Cod: Too creamy sauce for me, but it was very tender.
Dark Chocolate Sorbet: Very yummy, surprisingly rich for what it is made of.
Not the happiest about the 9 pound shot they added to my kombucha drink.

Atmosphere 10/10
Love the modern interior, very clean and perfectly temperate. Spacious between tables and lighting was super cool.

Service 7/10
Slightly lacking in attentiveness and were acting a bit defensive when I asked if there was any alcohol in my kombucha, but besides that, good service."
Scully,5.0,"Every bite was phenomenal and service was perfection. The dishes were dynamic, textural, tasty, and beautiful. Would 10000% recommend and can't wait to return on my next visit to London!"
Scully,4.0,The dishes and the flavours are really special and something you won‚Äôt get everyday. Loved the way food was displayed. The fish we had was simply ‚Äúwow‚Äù. We had a very nice evening at this place. However have to deduct one star as initially we were seated at a table next to the kitchen although other tables were available and we had reserved up front. We were also reminded before ordering dessert that we would have to leave within the next 15 min due to the next reservation coming up.
Scully,5.0,"Absolutely delicious and really interesting dishes, with sometimes unusual (but absolutely worth trying) flavour combinations. In particular, we loved the oyster mushrooms with yeast flake sauce - it tasted incredible and had so much flavour for something so simple. The staff were excellent, attentive and informative."
Scully,4.0,"Interesting and exploratory tasting menu. Vegetables were great; fish could be more tender. Reasonable prices overall.
Won‚Äôt be coming back, but worth trying!"
Scully,5.0,"This blew our expectations away. Great vibe (buzzy but relaxed), excellent friendly personable service, creative delicious dishes. Each had a fun riff on traditional flavor combinations. Vegetable dishes were a standout. Also an excellent wine list but prepare to splash out for the good stuff. Our waitress said we needed about 6 dishes to share among 3 people but 4-5 would have been fine. Cool open kitchen."
Scully,5.0,"Truly excellent driven by the passion of Scully himself. I been 4 times on a Saturday night over the past year or so and each time perfection has been delivered.

The staff are knowledgeable and will explain is needed, the way to eat each dish. The food is always well presented and prepared under the watchful eyes of the Owner/ Chef himself.

Booking essential. Give it a go !"
Scully,5.0,"My partner had been wanting to go here for ages and chose his birthday as the perfect time and it absolutely was.

Everything was perfect. The food was honestly insane, we shared the pork starter and the egg plant Sambal as our starters. And both had the BBQ Onglet as the mains.

I can‚Äôt fault anything - at all. It was divine!!!

The service was amazing too and we mentioned we were full and had cake at home for my partners birthday but my partner was still brought a little sweet treat and was excellent!!!! Superb food and service

10/10 from us.

On the way out I had to tell Chef Scully it was AMAZING! We hope to return soon!"
Scully,5.0,"Really impressed with the starters. I could‚Äôve just had those and been happy! The mains were good too, but less impressive (at least the fish was- it was good. The kombucha was delicious. Service was great, very friendly & attentive staff"
Scully,5.0,"What a wonderful experience. I have to say the two snacks we had before our starter were so outstanding I would class those as better than most restaurants I've been to. The asparagus, tahini with the mushroom vinaigrette - jeez, Louise, we knew we were in for a ride. The dessert, the olive oil cake was possibly in my top 3 desserts of all time. Everything in between was spot on - if anything, just the turnip cake starter was the only miss, but that's probably just my taste buds not prepared for the unami and savoury explosion in my mouth. Top notch, wonderful experience, wonderful people, will come back in the future for sure. So different."
Scully,5.0,"Fantastic, innovative food. Loved the black fig starter which is to die for - such interesting flavours which work so well together.   Wonderful wine, great service and relaxed professional ambience.  This restaurant sets a high bar and deserves to do well."
Scully,5.0,"The food is always outstanding‚Äîeach dish bursts with unique flavours and textures that are both creative and memorable. You can really tell the thought and care that goes into every plate. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the service consistently makes me feel at ease and well looked after. Truly a standout dining experience every time."
Scully,5.0,"We were a large group and managed to order just about the whole menu. The celiac accommodation (gluten-free) was fine, although there were several dishes I wanted to eat but could not. Overall the food was excellent, and I was excited to eat here after cooking from the Nopi cookbook for many years. The service was variable, often slow, and at times abrupt."
Scully,4.0,"Really impressed with the starters (we had the roasted pumpkin & the arepa)- I could‚Äôve just had those and been happy! The mains were good too, but less impressive (at least the fish was- it was good, but could‚Äôve used a bit more
Flavour). The kombucha was delicious but felt unreasonably priced at ¬£12. Service was great, very friendly & attentive staff."
Scully,2.0,"This was meant to be a very special night for our anniversary, but sadly the evening turned into an unpleasant experience. I tried to call the Restaurant Manager, Fernando, sent an email to report the below constructive feedback six weeks ago and chased once, but have never heard back - very disappointing for such a hyped, highly rated restaurant. Here is my critique:
1. Coffee machine: we were given the choice to either sit in the far left back towards the till and staff exit/entrance, on the right side along the aisle or on the left side at the window front. I chose the window front, in the hope that we will benefit from some natural daylight and views. About 30mins into our 5-course vegan tasting dinner, early diners started ordering coffee, and the machine, which sat right above my head behind me made such a loud noise that I could not hear my partner's voice anymore. This happened a number of times in short succession, which was very unpleasant, given this evening was about quality time and positive vibes, which didn't quite hold up against the coffee machine's noise.
2. Bread crumbs/setting the table: After the second course, there were breadcrumbs on the table. The dishes were cleared ahead of bringing the third course, but then the fresh plates and food were placed on the dirty table, which should have been wiped/cleaned between courses as there was sufficient time in between and this level of service can be expected at a restaurant of self-claimed high standards such as the Scully. Between dishes two and three, we had our cutlery cleaned away, but were not given a fresh set of it, so by the time the hot main course arrived, we did not have cutlery ready to start eating. This meant the dish was getting cold while trying to get a waiter's attention.
3. Ingredients: the third course (at this point we have been handled by three different team members already) we were served by a waitress who explained to us the ingredients/components of the dish in front of us. Unfortunately, she forgot the fifth and last ingredient, apologised and smiled and walked away. I totally understand that we are all humans and make mistakes or forget things, but at a pricey restaurant with sky-high reputation like the Scully, I would have expected staff to manage remembering 5 ingredients. That waiter also didn't care to find out what the final ingredient was and come back to us with the answer...
4. Smoking staff: I was sat facing the end of the room, looking toward the back exit/entrance next to the till. Staff was going in and out frequently. Whilst this would not have bothered me at all, the fact that they lit cigarettes in vicinity to us, well visible through the window front, was not very nice. I also did not get the impression that they would've washed their hands after coming back in, which left me with an unpleasant thought. Nothing against staff being allowed to keep their habits, but ideally not visible to guests.
5. Anniversary: despite placing the note in my reservation that this dinner was our anniversary, none of the staff (neither the hostess, nor any of the 4 waiters we had that night) mentioned a word about it and obviously also did not surprise us with a small gesture. This was very disappointing and whilst we wouldn't have expected to get anything, at least the mention and acknowledgment of it would have made us feel more welcome and valued.
Sadly, I won't return to this restaurant under current management as I did not feel valued and there was a clear lack of value for the money."
Scully,5.0,"Lovely experience! We were pleased by the high quality service, ambience and food.

We were seated at the ‚Äòcounter‚Äô which gives you a look in the kitchen and enables you to talk with the chefs. For a foodie like me that‚Äôs a dream come true.

We (2 persons) shared sever dishes, all prepared with so much love and dedication. My personal favorite was the mutton on bisbas.

We took 3 deserts cause they were all so amazing. Thanks again, props for the cooks and host."
Scully,5.0,"An unforgettable culinary journey at Scully ‚Äì truly a hidden gem in London.
From the moment we arrived at Scully, we knew we were in for a special experience. Tucked away in St James‚Äôs Market, this restaurant strikes a perfect balance between intimate and lively, refined and relaxed. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, with a beautifully designed open kitchen that lets you see the magic happen. You can instantly sense that this is a place driven by passion, creativity, and a genuine love for food.

The service was flawless from start to finish. Every member of the staff was professional, friendly, and deeply knowledgeable about the menu. Our server guided us through the dishes with thoughtful recommendations, and even shared interesting insights about the ingredients and inspirations behind some of the items. It felt like a truly personalised experience ‚Äî not just dining, but discovering."
Scully,5.0,"What a place. Meal of the year so far!

We sat at the counter which was great, as we had a good few chats with the chef's and could see all the dishes going out.

The food was crazy tasty. Highly recommend the corn bread which I think is their signature dish. We could have eaten only that and we'd have been happy."
Scully,5.0,"My favourite restaurant in London (favourite restaurant full stop!)
Scully pairs classic and unique flavours that will have you come back again and again, keen to try what you didn't order on the menu last time.
The tasting menu is a must with the vegan and vegetarian options on offer well worth ordering as well if you're dining as two.
The selection and pairing of wines on offer is fantastic and the service from the team is welcoming and professional."
Scully,5.0,"A beautiful vision executed perfectly on a plate. Every bite was a marvel and a mystery unwrapped by your own imagination. Personally, I tasted flavour combinations that sparked my inner child. I was grinning from ear to ear.

With all my joy and happiness, I found myself asking this burring question! Why are they feeding me like I am in an orphanage? I know it's fine dining but come on bruh they didn't have to do me like Oliver Twist.

Food so good I would have licked the plate. I shall return but next time just add an extra beef cheek or two."
Scully,5.0,"They ""Scully Restaurant is an absolute must-visit in London! The food is incredibly inventive with mind-blowing flavours, and the service is simply impeccable. The atmosphere is vibrant yet comfortable, making for a truly memorable dining experience. Highly, highly recommend!"""
Scully,5.0,"The best restaurant in London you‚Äôve never heard of.

PROS
-vibrant menu, not sticking to one cuisine, a nice fusion of various tastes
-presentation of dishes is beautiful, thinking of the curry courgette which looked like a caterpillar
-small, cosy and romantic restaurant; available for booking
-good location just off Piccadilly
-honestly some of the tastiest food iv had in London in 15 years
-chef Scully himself visible to customers as he is cooking in the open plan kitchen
-menu changes seasonally
-we got a free dessert as it was my friend‚Äôs birthday which was an olive sponge cake, very interesting combo

CONS
-expensive but given you are getting Michelin-star type food, it‚Äôs fair
-not many vegan options
-fairly small portions so you‚Äôll need at least 2 courses to feel full"
Scully,5.0,"Everything so well presentable and tasty. My favourite restaurant so far. Great quality and portions. Everything was amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to go back again.
The kitchen staff looked happy and even when they were super busy the vibe was very good. I can‚Äôt say what I liked the most because everything I had was delicious. The aubergines, the oyster mushrooms, the fried flatbread and cuttlefish were the best I ever had. Amazing food, service, and exceptional good cocktails"
Scully,3.0,"Nice vision, just not our flavor combos and was under seasoned for our taste. Innovation is a risky venture. Waiter was a little on top of us describing everything when the food should really be doing the talking. Some decent wines by the glass and so-so cocktails.  The arepas snack/starter stole the show and must be a popular item because it‚Äôs on their advertising. Unless you‚Äôve already tried everything on the block, you might do better elsewhere."
Scully,5.0,Phenomenal dining experience from start to finish! The staff was so knowledgeable and we could feel their joy of their work shine through. I highly recommend dining here.
Scully,5.0,"Please give Scully‚Äôs a star.
While you‚Äôre dining here, are you experiencing art? Science? Culture? Family? Travel? You‚Äôll have to determine this for yourself. All I can say is that I experienced all of the above and that  Scully and his team do not disappoint. An evening at Scully‚Äôs is more than words can do justice.

It is expensive, yes, but saving up to experience the magic that is Scully‚Äôs feels like a no-brainer for anyone who appreciates quality food and a fine dining experience (without the cold snootiness of other London restaurants). The commitment to sustainability and no waste is a huge bonus, and makes the investment taste that much better.

More plainly, the food is beyond excellent, innovative, and simply bliss. The staff bring grounding to the out-of-this-world culinary experience.

It has been nearly a year since enjoying a long evening here, yet my partner and I still, and frequently reflect fondly on the memory of the experience.

A few highlights were getting sat in the best corner seat in the house, the crispy stuffed chicken wing, the arepa, the staff‚Äôs extra special treatment for our anniversary, and finally the honor of being served by Scully himself as he debuted a new octopus dish.

Scully and his expert team are ahead of their time whilst being exactly where they need to be.

We cannot recommend highly enough that anyone keen to light up their senses and make a lasting memory go for the tasting menu to sample the breadth of wizardry that Scully‚Äôs has to offer. Finally, we weren‚Äôt certain we needed wine with each course, but opting for wine pairing deepened the flavor complexity beyond what we could fathom, elevating the food to stardom.

One thing is guaranteed, you will make a great memory and will not walk away hungry.

I hope to be able to go back soon."
Scully,3.0,"I‚Äôve dined here 30-40 times and have referred this restaurant to many many people. Used to sit at the bar and was very friendly with Chef Scully and his team! The service here - at least tonight - was really not what it used to be. The lady who seated me and took my order had an interesting accent. She was very rude when I asked her in a friendly manner where she was from or what her name was and then proceeded to say ‚Äúno I won‚Äôt tell you‚Äù and went on  to ignore me for the rest of the meal and have another server attend to me. There was zero creepiness or flirting in my ask - same way I‚Äôve asked hundreds of people in my lifetime. Really unprofessional and it made me feel very uncomfortable. This has never happened to me in my life. I travel for work and dine all the time and always have friendly banter with my server or bartender. I used to come here once a month, took a break for the past half a year and was about to resume. I will likely not be back given the very awkward and rude experience with this lady - it really ruined my meal. I‚Äôve never ever been treated like this in my life. The rest of the staff was incredibly friendly so that helped salvage the experience but I still have a weird pit in my stomach from that very odd interaction."
Scully,5.0,"Fantastic food. Amazing range of flavours, and great cocktails too. Really good service too - mentioned a dietary restriction for one of the guests during booking, and all of the staff attending to us were made aware. Admittedly on the pricier side but with excellent food and great service, you certainly get your money‚Äôs worth."
Scully,5.0,Another outstanding meal here. Many new items on the menu to try (the beef cheek rendang is on another level of indulgence!) plus some firm favourites (the arepa and the beef tendons are still amazing!). Impeccable service and great allergy awareness to boot.
Scully,5.0,"What a gem! The food takes fusion to another level. Flavours from across the globe appear together in fantastic combinations. The chef really demonstrates his international heritage and well travelled palate. We sampled 6 different dishes and struggled to pick a standout favourite as all of them were just so good. The parsnip sorbet was a revelation... Friendly, attentive service and very much allergy aware. If you're a MasterChef fan, the chef's counter provides a great view of the pass. Flawless place and now very much on the 'must go again' list!"
Scully,5.0,"Decided to come here for partner‚Äôs birthday after reading all the amazing reviews, we wouldn‚Äôt normally go for ‚Äòfusion‚Äô food but thought give this a try given the chef‚Äôs background. The food was interesting but I wouldn‚Äôt say the flavoring was ground breaking like many others. For me it‚Äôs more like a nostalgic taste and as if eating a combination of childhood flavors. Guess this is still a really nice thing. It‚Äôs fine the place didn‚Äôt recognize the special occasion but we weren‚Äôt impressed by the male staff who served us in the beginning; he was overly indifferent and then too busy chatting up the ladies next to us. Maya was super nice serving us in the end."
Scully,5.0,Truly amazing. We loved every dish. We have eaten at many multi-Michelin starred restaurants and this is up the top of the list. The vegan tasting was better than the OG one (I thought) with the layered celeriac going down as possibly one of the best things I have ever eaten. Thank you!
Scully,5.0,Incredible culinary experience in London! This full open plan style kitchen offers a variety of fusions of cuisines presented into the most umami bites of food. Highly recommend the Arepa and the mushrooms were my favorite.
Scully,5.0,This is without doubt one of my very favourite restaurants in London. The food is exceptional and the service always friendly yet professional. Very good value as well considering the depth of the cookery and quality of ingredients used. Would highly recommend!! üôå ‚Ä¶
Scully,5.0,"Visited with my best friend we both had the vegan tasting menu. The food was excellent in every way but the service elevated everything! From the moment I walked in I was well looked after, I just had to mention the word phone charger and somebody grabbed one plugged it in by my table before I‚Äôd sat down. The service was at the right level of a mixture between formal & relaxed. Out waitress despite only having worked there for 2 weeks was knowledgeable, delivered great conversation and most importantly was passionate about her job.

I‚Äôll be back‚Ä¶next time with my wife for a special occasion."
Scully,5.0,"I booked Scully as a birthday present for my sister, having been recommended it by multiple people. We were not disappointed!

From start to finish, we were completely looked after by our servers Luis & Zaf, and Chef Scully himself. We sat at the table by the kitchen and really feel this enhanced the experience as we got to watch the skill and preparation going into the food, as well as chatting to the Head Chef about the ingredients and flavour combos.

We enjoyed the Vegan Tasting Menu & it was so exciting to be able to eat so much quality vegan food, and not feel these dishes were an afterthought on the menu!

A 10/10 experience that I cannot fault, and cannot wait until we return again!"
Scully,5.0,"Wow if you don't pass by on your holiday, you are missing out! Spend your money here The food is very very good, compliments to the staff!! üç∑"
Scully,5.0,Amazing food. I would definitely recommend going. The staff are understanding and patient and the atmosphere as a whole is fabulous!
Scully,5.0,"Easiest TOP 5 restaurants I‚Äôve ate in London restaurants and I been to a lot of places. Wow, where do I begin... the place is small, but very cozy. The service is excellent, our waitress was so thoughtful, answered all our curious questions about dishes. We had Arepa, Eggplant Sambal, Char-Grilled Broccoli with Salted Egg Yolk, Dry Aged Halibut, a Chicken and Pineapple Creme Br√ªl√©e‚Äôs. Every dish was made to perfection, I‚Äôm usually not a huge fan of Asian Fushion, but I was amazed by all the flavours and how well put together and balanced it was. The prices are high end, but worth it for the quality of food and service. Thank you very much and will be back soon for sure to try rest of the menu."
Scully,5.0,It‚Äôs been an amazing opportunity visiting Scully restaurant. They got really good food with fabulous service and they all were very friendly and helpful. I can‚Äôt wait to visit there again. I highly recommend everyone should visit this restaurant. I can make sure that u gonna love it üòç
Scully,5.0,"I've eaten here a number of times as the menu changes. Some staples like Arepa would cause a riot if removed from the menu, it is so delicious. But new dishes highlight some amazing cuisine, like the pork belly rendang spring rolls."
Scully,4.0,"An enjoyable experience. Overall I thought the food was nice, but wasn‚Äôt necessarily blown away by it. It was good to see there was a range of vegetarian options. The stand outs were the arepa and the green matcha cake but some of the other dishes were a little underwhelming. However the staff was very friendly and offered advice on ordering."
Scully,5.0,Tasting menu is as unique as it gets. Scully gave us a few plates on the house. Service was very personal and on point. One of the best menus I‚Äôve eaten.
Scully,5.0,"My Dinner at Scully St James‚Äôs ‚Äì A Seriously Memorable Meal

I finally got to try Scully in St James‚Äôs last night, and wow I‚Äôm already thinking about when I can go back. Everything about the evening just worked: the setting, the service, and especially the food.

The place has this warm, intimate vibe without being stuffy.There‚Äôs a real energy to the room laid back music, friendly staff, and a sense that you‚Äôre about to eat something a bit different.

We did the three-course menu, and honestly, every dish surprised me in a good way."
Scully,5.0,"Scully is a must-visit for its inventively spiced, globally influenced dishes, charismatic service, and lively open-kitchen setting‚Äîremarkable cooking that justifies the price tag."
Scully,5.0,"Absolutely incredible and sensational food. The texture, flavours and presentation were all incredible but also very innovative. I am a foodie and have been to Scully a few times and the menu is always creative, one of my favourite places in London. Scully is able to combine different flavours in an innovative fashion to bring jt to the next level, combining different Eastern flavours with a slight touch of Mediterranean and the end result is explosively delicious. Service was also impeccable, nice to see a restaurant full of people again post covid. Highly recommend to anyone who loves food."
Scully,5.0,"Wow, I think I am going to be a vegetarian ! So great, rich strong flavours. Amazing. Highly recommend the oyster mushrooms (seriously like a meat dish), arepa (most recommended) and the halibut is as good as well. Lovely. Will come back"
Scully,4.0,"Having opened his own eponymous restaurant, ex-NOPI chef Ramael Scully now has free reins to experiment in both cooking style and ingredients, and the results are stunning in the main, but also rather mixed in parts. The kohlrabi starter was delightful, but the arepa was safe to the point of forgettable. The halibut and stone bass mains both brought out the best in the fish and should be commended. The ice cream and cookie was another 'swing for the fences' dish that came close to being a home run, if not for the miso caramel. The other desserts were good but unremarkable.

The space felt crowded and the acoustics were awful, unfortunately. Our waitress was professional and we appreciated not being rushed to vacated our table after 2 hours 15 minutes - yes they were that specific."
BAO Soho,4.0,"Wanted to try this place for long time. I loved the chicken BAO and scallops in the shell. However, the prawn BAO was too overwhelming as the bread was sweet, and too much garlic ( I‚Äôm a garlic lover by the way) yet this one I couldn‚Äôt eat.
The drink o ordered, salted lemonade was delicious ."
BAO Soho,5.0,"After a very disappointing gastronomic journey in London my partner and I needed a win. BAO soho was exactly that.
Everything was delicious, perfect temperature and great service. Also attention to detail and recommendations from the staff were all spot-on. Would come back easily and look forward to doing so!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"When I went to Bao Soho, despite it being a Saturday I was lucky enough to get a table straight away. I ordered the battered sweet potato, beef rump with white soy, beef cheek nuggets, scallop, confit pork bao, fried chicken bao and prawn bao. I‚Äôve been to 2 other Bao brunches and none of them have disappointed. I love that they all have little variations in their menu which allows me to try different things. I was a big fan of everything  I ordered."
BAO Soho,5.0,Good authentic baos. The 40 day aged beef over rice is a must! Seating capacity is limited to about 30 people so it's best to have a reservation. Staff was friendly and attentive!
BAO Soho,5.0,"The 40 Day Aged Beef Rice was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. So savoury and full of flavour. I would totally recommend you to try that!
And of course the baos also deserve a try, different flavours, all great! Final mention to the exceptional service.

Totally recommend to book in advance, otherwise the wait can be long (~1 hour)"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Booking ahead of time really sped things up. We ordered the beef rice, which was incredible and was ready very quickly after some great starters, the aubergine was a standout in particular.

Great restaurant, will definitely be coming back!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Absolutely blown away by this place! The bao and xiao chi were phenomenal ‚Äî like, flavor explosions in every bite. But the real star of the show? That 40-day aged beef steak rice with egg yolk‚Ä¶ holy hell. Rich, tender, melt-in-your-mouth goodness ‚Äî total game changer.
Cool vibe, super chill staff, and food that hits hard. Already planning my next visit. Do yourself a favor and go."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Great experience. The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äî every bite packed with flavor. Highlights were the eggplant and the eggs. A special shoutout to Everson, who welcomed us with such warmth and made the whole evening even better."
BAO Soho,4.0,"I've been going to Bao in Soho for the best part of 7 years, it's still a must visit and it's still one of my favourite spots in London. (Some notes though)

Bao's Soho branch has been sneakily proving some of London's best food for a while now. The store itself is a quite small, so if you're bigger like me, be prepared. The service makes up for any discomfort easily though, professional waiters on the absolute top of their game. Top marks.

The food has always been good, but some dishes are better than others. The bao, counterintuitivly, is actually not at all the highlight. For me, the blood pudding is as good as it gets; so flavourful, homely and better with the egg yolk. Also, their chicken is fantastic, but nothing will beat the pig trotter nuggets they used to sell.

Worth giving the deserts a shot as well, but be careful because, as good as the food is, it is probably a bit too expensive. Their unique drinks are also worth treating yourself to.

Fair warning, book ahead. You'll be waiting if not. My only note to the restaurant is to pass on the pickled veg, or perhaps wait until the food arrives. It's brilliant picked food, but it has a strong, strong smell.

Of course I'll be back."
BAO Soho,4.0,"I really enjoyed my dining experience here. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.

The baos are AMAZING, definitely try those out.

I had the mushrooms, the balance in the soy sauce was off, making it too sour.

The rice bowl was okay.

The friend chicken is good.

The Taiwanese beer is yum!

The place is expensive and the quantity is slightly less, but it does fill you up.

Would definitely reccomend trying this place out."
BAO Soho,5.0,"I finally got the chance to try Bao after hearing so much about it and it was well worth the wait in the queue!

From the moment I walked in, the experience was fantastic. Special shoutout to Everson, who truly elevated my visit. It was my first time at Bao and he went above and beyond to help me choose what to order. He gave such thoughtful and detailed explanations of the dishes and even shared his personal favorites, which made the whole process feel so warm and welcoming.

I went with the aubergine on his recommendation, and wow. That dish was insane. A 10/10. The sweet notes, paired with a kick of chilli oil, a light crunch from the tempura, and a subtle touch of garlic‚Ä¶ it all just worked. It was beautifully balanced and packed with flavor.

Next up was the fried chicken bao bun, also recommended by Everson, and again, no notes. Perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and so satisfying. Honestly, it hit the spot.

Overall, this was a 10/10 experience. The food was phenomenal, the atmosphere was great, and the service was exceptional. Someone please give Everson a promotion, he absolutely deserves it!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Bao Soho in London serves the best Taiwanese food I‚Äôve ever had! The bao buns are soft, fluffy, and packed with incredible flavor, and the bubble tea is perfectly balanced and refreshing. Every bite feels authentic and made with care. A must-visit for anyone who loves great food!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Really cute spot to have amazing bao! The meet was super juicy, side dishes are super flavourful and the prices are adequate. The staff is very attentive and kind. This was overall a great experience - remember to book your table before coming !"
BAO Soho,4.0,"Service and drinks by the bartender waitress were excellent! Very friendly and warm. Not many bao options in the menu, but the taste was on point and definitely satisfied my asian taste buds. Had the pork bao (that was tender and the right amount of fats) and the fried daikon bao (that was crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside with a nice kick of that spicy sauce). Would definitely by back to try more!"
BAO Soho,5.0,Food came out fast and I loved the flavours of the egg with the mature cheese and egg. Chicken was also crispy and delicious and Horlicks ice cream malty and creamy. A great lunch with delicious flavours.
BAO Soho,5.0,Incredible food and superb service. Very reasonable prices. The scallop was a highlight.
BAO Soho,5.0,"Perfect place for quick lunch with good deal. Top up with a bubble tea, won‚Äôt let you downüßãit would be perfect with an even better texture of the rice"
BAO Soho,4.0,Excellent restaurant. I went because it was in the Michelin guide. Extremely clean and organized. Attentive staff who ask about dietary restrictions. Innovative and delicious menu. Light and fluffy bao buns. Lived up to my expectations. I liked it so much that ended up buying the T-shirt they sell because the recipe book (which was what I really wanted as a souvenir for my trip) was too heavy to carry in my suitcase.
BAO Soho,3.0,"I've eaten food from Bao since it started as market stall in East London. The food used to be so delicious and it has changed quite a bit since then, which is understandable given the expansion and clientele.

I'm very glad Bao is representing Taiwanese food (although the taste of the dishes aren't the same as how they would taste in Taiwan, which is a also a shame) but I wish the food is produced with more love and care.

We ate at Bao Soho and tried the fried squid bao and one of the deep fried chicken steaks. Fried squid bao was not too bad, although meatier squid would have added more colour to the texture. So most of the time, I felt like I was eating deep fried batter instead of squid. The deep fried chicken steak was VERY VERY salty. The texture was OK, and not too dry. The saltiness made it hard to eat though. I'm not sure if everyone who ordered a chicken steak have had the same salty experience. Deep fried chicken steaks in Taiwan are delicious, tender, juicy and definitely not salty!

The main chef (a guy with glasses) had a very bad attitude. We could hear him moaning and talking loudly about a customer's order while we were eating, which ruined the experience for us. It's very unprofessional!

The waiter/waitress were polite and helpful though, which compensated our experience."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Big shoutout to JD and the whole crew at BAO Soho. I had the fried chicken steak, some bao, and the nuggets and honestly, 10/10. That fried chicken steak could solve problems. That lime chilli is something else. The nuggets were massive and the sauces that came with it was crazy good.

Honestly tho, what really made it hit different wasn‚Äôt just the food, but it was the people. JD and the team didn‚Äôt just serve us, they took care of us. The atmosphere was warm, real, and full of good energy. You could feel the heart behind it all. The team was solidddd.

Appreciate the hospitality, the flavours, and the whole experience. I‚Äôll be back for sure, food was crazy good, but the team was hella great!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Superb Bao (hardly surprising) . The peanut on the classic Bao really made it. The chicken and the non alcoholic cocktail choices were excellent. It's a really small place, booking is pretty much essential, even as a solo diner. Otherwise the queue can be quite long(across the street). There are now a number of Baos across London. This is my favourite."
BAO Soho,4.0,"Happened to be around this area so decided to drop by this for a quick lunch. The party of  two queued in front of me got told it‚Äôd be 20 min wait but I got seated pretty quickly on my own. It was busy when I went in around 12:30 and then it went quiet for a bit before the crowd came again.

It was pretty easy to place the order using the QR code and the food came fairly quickly thereafter - I ordered the classic pork and beef brisket bao, as well as the pineapple float. The beef brisket bao wasn‚Äôt listed as spicy on the menu but there was a kick to it, thanks to the refreshing pineapple soda to wash down the chilli, so i definitely preferred the classic pork one with the tasty peanut sauce. Overall I enjoyed the meal but I recommended checking with the staff if you can‚Äôt stand chilli‚Äôs and also visit early as the place isn‚Äôt big and it does get full up easily."
BAO Soho,5.0,Totally worth the hype. Flavors on point. DO make a reservation. The day before was enough. Excellent service.
BAO Soho,4.0,"Food portion is small, as the limited space as it is in the restaurant. Staff is very nice. Somewhere that is suitable for trying something out for the first time."
BAO Soho,5.0,One of the best service ever! Foods and drinks are very unique and perfect.
BAO Soho,4.0,"I recently had dinner at this restaurant, and I left thoroughly impressed. The service was both efficient and friendly, with a team that was attentive and welcoming.

The ¬£15 menu is excellent value for money. It includes a bao of your choice, which was absolutely delicious, followed by crispy chicken that was perfectly crunchy and flavorful. The meal was rounded off with a bowl of rice and guinea fowl, which was well-prepared and packed with taste. Every dish was well-balanced and satisfying.

For dessert, I couldn‚Äôt resist the Fried Chocolate Ice Cream. It was a true indulgence, with the perfect balance of crisp and creamy textures.

I highly recommend this restaurant for a simple, tasty, and affordable meal!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Superb place! Easily the best Bao I‚Äôve had, the Kale salad and aubergine were delicious."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Excellent cuisine! The fried chicken is delicious and absolutely worth trying. The bao buns are also very tasty. The only downside is that the space is quite small, and the wall hooks for coats aren‚Äôt ideally placed‚Äîwhen they‚Äôre full, they can be a bit uncomfortable and get in the way. Aside from this minor issue, the overall experience is fantastic. The flavors are authentic, and the dishes are well-prepared. Friendly and attentive staff make the visit even more enjoyable. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a great meal in a cozy setting!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Great food, great service and was affordable! Ate out in London constantly for 3 days and this place was our favourite! Good veggie/ vegan options too."
BAO Soho,5.0,Everything was so delicious and served as soon as it was ready so the temperatures were perfect (especially the horlicks ice cream bao). Super nice service too!
BAO Soho,4.0,"LUNAR NEW YEAR FEAST üßßü•¢
üìç Soho, London
‚≠êÔ∏è 4/5
üí∏ ¬£¬£

To ring in the Chinese Lunar New Year, we headed to our go-to spot, @bao_london‚Äîthis time in Soho. We were hoping to try their exclusive Year of the Snake menu, only to realize this location didn‚Äôt have it üò¢. But hey, no complaints‚Äîwe made up for it by going all in!

We started with their Classic BAO, fried chicken, and melt-in-your-mouth beef short rib‚Äîeach one as good as ever. Then, we couldn‚Äôt resist some specials, including the honey-glazed pork bao (sweet, sticky perfection) and the Snake Bao with pistachio cream to finish on a sweet note.

Even without the special menu, it was a proper feast‚ÄîBao never disappoints! ü•¢üî•"
BAO Soho,5.0,"If you don‚Äôt mind the short wait to be seated, it‚Äôs an incredible experience for the food and Asian atmosphere."
BAO Soho,5.0,Everything in this place is just ‚Äúmust-try‚Äù ! I loved the foods I tried. The staffs were so friendly and polite.
BAO Soho,5.0,Super delicious! Food is incredible. And Jade from the staff is the loveliest person you‚Äôll ever meet.
BAO Soho,5.0,"Delicious BAO buns, you can see them being freshly made and taste so good. We tried the pork bao which was incredible"
BAO Soho,5.0,Such a good place to eat! And now we have crossed this place off our bucket list.
BAO Soho,5.0,"Bao! Darling Bao!!! ü©∑ what a sweet little spot to have lunch/dinner/whatever! the baos are sooo worth it, likely the best you can get in London. I would say the best one by far is the beef short rib bao, tastes like an elevated hamburger, melt-in-your-mouth texture, packed with sweet n savoury flavour. The other two were very good but didn‚Äôt blow me away as they were not super distinct.

The sides were all good, I was most impressed by the pickles which are a MUST if you liked pickled things! I think they switch the veggies up once in a while as well so you get to try what‚Äôs in season. I thought the aubergine could‚Äôve had a bit more deep-sweet sauciness and the rice a bit more salt but yum! The fresh cucumber was a lovely addition.

The drinks also!!! Let‚Äôs not understate them! The grape-ade is unbelievable, the perfect sourness and the grape flavour is indulgently candy-like, but it‚Äôs fizzy and makes it both childish and refined, an impressive balance. Only little sad thing is that they didn‚Äôt have green tea but that‚Äôs ok because the tea was still tasty üíï

Overall such a recommend, so worth it!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Super delicious food and at a very good price for the quality that they offer. They are also very kind and efficient. Overall, a great experience"
BAO Soho,4.0,"The service was exceptional‚Äîstaff were friendly, efficient, and made us feel very welcome. The food was fantastic, living up to the high expectations set by its reputation. Each dish was a flavorful adventure, particularly the signature baos, which were perfectly balanced in taste and texture.

However, the dining space is quite confined, which can make it feel a bit cramped, especially during peak hours. Additionally, it was quite hot inside, which detracted somewhat from the overall comfort. Despite these minor inconveniences, the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and service you receive.

In summary, Bao offers excellent food and great service at good prices, but the limited space and heat inside are areas that could use some improvement."
BAO Soho,4.0,"Came here for a post-work dinner with a friend.  I booked ahead knowing from the pictures how small this place was.  We arrived at 17:30 in the evening and unfortunately there were no tables available so we sat at the counter facing the bar.  As I learned later on, it wasn't ideal being right next to a sink as water from the sink often splashed up onto us.

However, moving on from that we ordered our drinks both cocktails, I had the sake beer and my companion the sweet potato gin.  Both were excellently prepared.  Tap water was requested and provided as a bottle with two glasses for us to fill.

As we were ordering before 6pm, we managed to take advantage of the ¬£15 set menu which was a side, bao bun and rice bowl.  The choices weren't great but what was there was enough for us to go for it.  Bao wise we got a Classic and Fried Chicken, for the sides we got the mushroom and fried chicken and both rice bowls which were aubergine and guinea fowl.  The bao's were excellent as you can expect, especially the buns themselves, they were fluffy warm and soft holding their fillings perfectly.  The fillings themselves were great and went down very easily!  I could've had many more.

The sides were good, but nothing amazing.  Fried chicken wasn't winning any awards and the mushrooms were made better with the small pieces of pickled shitake mushrooms which massively elevated the dish.  The rice bowls were ok, the guinea fowl was probably lost on me as it just tasted like gamey rice with a hint of richness from the egg yolk.  I personally preferred the aubergine rice more but again, nothing crazy and there were no particular flavours shouting out.

I decided to order the weeping Sake which was smooth dry and delicious and we got a couple of more buns, one classic and one braised shortrib.  No complaints on those, both delicious as you would expect from a place named 'Bao'

Overall a good place to get tasty and authentic bao buns but not somewhere I'd visit again as all the other dishes seem a bit pointless to me.  Just do more bao buns please!!

Also due to the quick turnaround at this place it did feel quite rushed and the food was coming out too quickly would you believe!  Yes, there is such a thing as food arriving at the table too quickly!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"I had a lovely solo meal here this evening. The fried chicken bao and the 49 day aged beef rice were really tasty, the perfect amount of food for 1 person. I want to say a special thanks for the lady who was working as front of house this evening. She was very kind and helpful and made my meal even better. Thank you!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Maitre d was fantastic. Our table was not quite ready for allocated time, he seated us at the bar and sorted our drinks whilst the table was cleaned. Staff were all polite, friendly and knowledgeable. Food was amazing. For the price point this place is fantastic and highly recommend any who hasn‚Äôt been to book ASAP. Our only feedback would be some low level music in the background would add a little more ambience."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Interior of this place never disappoints, small but very cute. It is pricey but the food is filling and delicious. Very surprised with the aubergine, thought it wouldn‚Äôt be that nice but absolutely loved the flavours.

Service is quick and very helpful from when you come in and when you leave too. Beautiful staff"
BAO Soho,5.0,amazing food & super lovely staff! would absolutely come back and recommend :-)
BAO Soho,4.0,First time trying BAO & loved my meal (the beef rice dish & the chicken bao). But the best part was Francine (I believe her name is) she was one of the waiting staff. So lovely & charming while managing the queue/wait. She walked me through the menu perfectly w/great recommendations. Just perfect service from her (didn‚Äôt interact w/others but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre lovely too). Food took a while too but she made sure to address that too w/ me.
BAO Soho,3.0,The lunch set is a nice way to sample 3 different dishes. I liked the pickled and grilled mushrooms. It was perfect if you don‚Äôt want something heavy. It had a nice sweet and slightly pickled flavor which paired well with the smokiness from the grill. The confit pork bao was a bit dry and it was lacking flavor. I was expecting rich pork flavors but it was subtle and there wasn‚Äôt too much sauce on top. The rice bowl had simple flavors as well.
BAO Soho,5.0,Food is delicious. The shrimps bao is excellent. A background music would have made the atmosphere more interesting. Great experience overall
BAO Soho,5.0,Delicious baos. We tried quite a few; favorites ones were the classic and fried chicken. The lemonade with milk foam was also amazing! We queued up by giving phone number and 15 minutes later got texted with available table. Very smooth and nice process
BAO Soho,4.0,"Good food, great service, pricing feels a bit high now compared to a few years ago."
BAO Soho,5.0,Top experience. Baos take you to heaven. Highly recommended!!!!! Order black pudding - don‚Äôt be scared
BAO Soho,5.0,"Both the food and the service were exceptional. It was our first  time, but we'll be back."
BAO Soho,5.0,"I arrived with my son. Service, excellent. Food extremely tasty and very well presented."
BAO Soho,5.0,Would recommended the chicken nuggets and fried chicken bao.
BAO Soho,5.0,Tiny but very nice. Our waitress could not be nicer (Jade?). Thanks to her for her kindness. We ordered two daily menus. Amount of food was not awesome but we did not finish lunch being hungry. I'ld go back. I'ld suggest to improve the bathroom but considering the little space you have I guess it's impossible.
BAO Soho,5.0,The boa buns were really nice! Had the pleasure of trying 4 different flavours and they were tasty. Lemon and honey ice tea was very refreshing. Would definitely recommend for a quick snack.
BAO Soho,5.0,"We stopped in here for lunch between museum visits.  Small compact place with efficient friendly service.  We had the kale salad and 4 different kinds of Bao.  We had the classic, duck, beef short rib and crispy fried chicken. Really enjoyed all our baos and the kale salad.  Highly recommend stopping here."
BAO Soho,5.0,"I‚Äôve been wanting to try this place for so long and finally did it during my trip. I really enjoyed the food here, not only everything I ordered tasted delicious, it also reminds me home. My fav was the beef soup, scallop, sliced beef and rice bowl."
BAO Soho,5.0,Tight quarters but quick service. Nice server in middle for conversation if you‚Äôre willing. Food came out very fast. Bao buns were delicious and the drink selection was great. Would come back
BAO Soho,5.0,"Small & cosy environment with friendly staffs. Although it is on the pricier side, the food was really good! Really love the fried holick ice-cream bao ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Do try the Pineapple float & their bubble tea!. We visited the soho outlet :)"
BAO Soho,5.0,Very delightful dinner and the service was quite perfect!
BAO Soho,5.0,We were here 2 hours ago for my daughter‚Äôs birthday and pre-theatre meal. Absolutely faultless! Excellent food and service. Would definitely come back!
BAO Soho,5.0,Seamless reservation experience online 1 day prior and promptly seated upon arrival- absolutely delicious food and did not have to wait long for it - would return again
BAO Soho,5.0,"The food was delicious and well made, we really enjoyed it!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Another favourite of mine. 10/10 as always. The mapo aubergine is completely out of this world, one of the tastiest things I‚Äôve ever had, cast iron 10/10. Pork belly bao also wild. Please have a beer too, one of the best, another 10/10. Would highly recommend this joint."
BAO Soho,5.0,"The only downside to this is that they don‚Äôt have that many to choose from, however, what they offer is yummy and delicious anyway!
Went with my friend and we got the aubergine with wonton crisps, sweet potato fries, and from the buns we got the classic, pork, and chicken and they were so good - the bun was fluffy and the filling was so flavourful. Really great combination of flavours.

You usually have to wait for some time but that‚Äôs not surprising considering the restaurant‚Äôs location, and who would mind waiting for great quality food?

Plus, have you seen their website?! What a masterpiece!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Loved it! What a great combination of flavours! The duck, the pork, the fried chicken, very very nice! Portions are small and it's a good thing, because you can order a lot of small plates and enjoy so many flavours.

There is always a queue so better get there early, staff is friendly and there is no rush despite being packed.

Definitely a place to go back again."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Friendly staff, great food üòÉ Enjoyed x Baolicious!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Always an amazing time in any Bao. Superb food, lovely friendly service and great vibes"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Bao London is my go-to spot whenever I'm craving delicious Taiwanese cuisine with a modern twist.

With locations scattered across the city, it‚Äôs the perfect place to enjoy a range of Taiwanese delights, whether you‚Äôre dining in or grabbing a quick bite to-go.

The menu is a fantastic mix of traditional and modern flavors. I highly recommend trying the xiao chi (small bites) and noodles, but the real stars of the show are their signature BAOs.

The classic bao and prawn bao are absolutely worth the wait‚Äîthere are few things in life worth queueing for, but these definitely are!

The pillowy buns and perfectly balanced fillings make each bite an explosion of flavor.
If you‚Äôre a fan of bubble tea, their drink options are a great accompaniment to your meal.

Bao London never disappoints. It‚Äôs a staple for me, and once you try it, it‚Äôll likely be one for you too!"
BAO Soho,5.0,I guess the queue outside somehow leverages my expectation on this restaurant. I dropped in for a light meal after school. I didn‚Äôt wait so long to be seated at the bar once it opened thanks to I am a solo-traveler. Small shop but serving promptly delicious tasty bao. I would ordered for some more if I wasn't go alone. Will definitely be back next time I am in the capital with my husband
BAO Soho,5.0,We loved the food and atmosphere! Definitely recommend it
BAO Soho,4.0,"The BAO that started it all - I remember the queue snaking around the corner just to get in just a few years back, which is luckily no longer the case - but do book in advance. While the food is still excellent, I can‚Äôt help but feel that success has dimmed this chain‚Äôs light.

Everything we had was delicious, especially the pickles, bao buns, and aubergine dip; also, the sauce next to the nuggets was out of this world - I‚Äôd have a whole plate of it if it was an option. The drinks were nice - we had the yakult float and peanut milk; I‚Äôd recommend the latter for dessert as it‚Äôs quite sweet.

So why the lost star? First, portion size - the dishes are tiny and entirely unsuitable for sharing. Even the ‚Äúlarger‚Äù ones, like the Guinea fowl bowl, had barely any fowl and provided maybe five bites between the two of us. Very little value for money. Secondly, the service - some of the starters came so late we‚Äôd already finished our mains, and the waiters never came to check in on us. It took about 20 minutes before we were even approached. And lastly, our seats were low, uncomfortable, and in the way of the staff.

So while BAO continues to offer top-notch Taiwanese in the capital, I‚Äôm afraid the customer is no longer at the heart of what they do. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre doing well, but the experience was alienating - and I‚Äôve been to several BAO locations so can sadly say it‚Äôs this way across the board. Here‚Äôs hoping they remember why they started the place - to give people yummy food and introduce their culture to the world."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Very good, very cozy (the place is small ish but I felt like we had our little bubble)
The staff was very nice and helped us choose our plates. It was my first time ever and we got out of there with belly and heart full. Part of my highlight while visiting London"
BAO Soho,5.0,Really tasty bao buns. If you‚Äôre coming at peak hours you may have to book a table or wait a while in line. You can always take them away with you like we did. The service is also really friendly and it‚Äôs a great price for London.
BAO Soho,5.0,"Sitting here writing my review before I leave. Every single member of staff provided a wonderful level of customer service, which was met by an equally wonderful level of food. Well done! Fantastic experience!!!"
Luca,5.0,"The fried potato was unexpectedly great, would highly recommend them as well as the scallops which were cooked perfectly complemented by the sauce. The pastas were also well presented and tasty but I did find them too salty.

The interior is beautiful and service is excellent as expected. Would be a great place for special occasions."
Luca,5.0,"I‚Äôve been to my fair share of Michelin star restaurants and Luca deservedly stands amongst the best in London. From the service, to the interior design/decor, all the way to the food. Attention to detail is something that is clearly drilled into the entire staff. The level of care and professionalism provided such a relaxed and memorable dining experience. We went for the Chefs Menu for 3 guests and every course was close to being faultless. It was a fine example of simplicity done right with fresh ingredients and textures. I found myself asking the waiter about certain elements in each course that caught my attention as I was eating.
As you would expect, the waiting staff was informative and attentive. It‚Äôs visibly obvious to see that the standards are set very high and it was hard for me to find faults with the service at any point.
Whenever I find similarities in specific dishes that I‚Äôve had elsewhere, I tend to play the comparison game. Before going to Luca, the best fine dining pork dish I‚Äôd had was at Trinity in Clapham. On the chefs menu they served us a pork dish with beans and apricots. To say this was the standout dish by mile is an understatement, officially making it the best pork dish I‚Äôve ever had. This is the true level of Michelin and it‚Äôs exactly what brings customers back for more.

Highly recommend"
Luca,5.0,"It‚Äôs a superb place - amazing ambience. Is loud but not very loud. I was here with a client. Was fun. Food was top quality and service was good.

If I had to pick one suggestion / improvement - the staff appeared to be pressurizing with respect to ordering wine. Like trying to fill the glass more quickly than we desire as then we would have to order a new bottle. This sometimes felt a bit odd. But otherwise delighted with everything I saw and received."
Luca,4.0,"ITALIAN MICHELIN MAGIC üáÆüáπ‚ú®
üìç Clerkenwell, London
‚≠êÔ∏è 5/5
üí∏ ¬£¬£¬£¬£
üç¥Craving a proper Italian fine dining experience? @lucarestaurant is that place. From the moment you step inside this stunning Clerkenwell spot, housed in a beautifully restored 18th-century building, you know you're in for something special. Awarded a #MichelinStar, it brings Italian cooking into the modern age, balancing elegance with comfort and tradition with creativity üî•
We went for their set menu and honestly, every single course felt like a masterpiece. Top highlights? The Roast Orkney #Scallops with Jerusalem artichoke and ‚Äònduja: rich, spicy, and perfectly cooked. The #Parmesan Fries? Unexpected, crispy, cheesy heaven. And let‚Äôs talk about the LUCA #Tiramis√π, hands down the best I‚Äôve had in #London, creamy, bold, and just sweet enough ü§§ If you're after a refined foodie moment, this place nails it. The service is warm, the vibe is chic but not pretentious, and the food? Impeccable ‚≠êÔ∏è"
Luca,5.0,"Good italian restaurant - there were indoor and outdoor seatings. Place was quite full - reservation is highly recommended.

Service was great - I celebrated my birthday here, and there were nice gestures which included a birthday card from the restaurant, as well as a small canape with birthday candle. Server was attentive and explained the food well, which included pointing out foods that don't meet our dietary restrictions.

Food was superb - we had parmesan fries, burrata, cured stone bass, prawn spaghetti, pesto tortellini, lemon tart, and affogato. Our favorite was the parmesan fries and stone bass. Wait time was a bit long, but the food was worth it. There was a selection of good drinks too."
Luca,5.0,"We came to Luca to celebrate my mom‚Äôs birthday and had a wonderful experience. The restaurant is cozy with a warm, welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff.

The food was absolutely delicious‚Äîjust as we had hoped. Their spin on Cacio e Pepe was especially amazing, full of rich flavor with a unique twist.

A great spot for a special occasion or a nice night out. Highly recommend!"
Luca,5.0,"Wanted to try this place for ages since it gained a star, and the lunch did not disappoint. Opted for the (unconventional!) signature Parmesan fries, cured bass, beef fillet, and tiramisu. Tiramisu was standout - as was the delicious and delicate Luca martini. Will definitely return to try more of the menu!"
Luca,5.0,"Tucked just up the road from Farringdon and Smithfield, Luca delivers modern Italian dining with real finesse.

Opened in 2016 and awarded its well-deserved Michelin star in 2021, it‚Äôs an ideal choice for a refined yet efficient lunch in the heart of Clerkenwell.

The interior blends contemporary bistro style with thoughtful design. On entry, you‚Äôll find cubicle-style seating on the left and a bar on the right with a direct view into the open kitchen. The main dining room is in a separate space‚Äîfeaturing mid-century-style wooden and leather banquettes, glass partitions for privacy, Zaragoza pendant lighting, and a generous lightwell that fills the room with warmth.

I went for the express lunch menu‚Äîexcellent value at ¬£32 for two courses or ¬£38 for three.

Starter: Fried Jerusalem Artichoke with King Oyster Mushroom and Roscoff Onion
Beautifully grilled artichokes were topped with a punchy red pepper and onion salsa, alongside meaty mushrooms enhanced by a rich moderno sauce. Every bite offered smoky depth and umami‚Äîan outstanding and generous starter.

Main: John Dory with Grezzina Courgette, Yellow Raisins, and a Saffron & Kaffir Lime Bisque
This dish was a visual and flavourful delight. The John Dory was perfectly cooked, set atop a vibrant bisque that echoed the richness of lobster, balanced with the fragrant lift of kaffir lime and tomato. The sweetness of the raisins and courgette salsa contrasted beautifully, though the courgette strips leaned a touch salty. Nonetheless, a standout plate in both portion and presentation.

Dessert: Tiramisu
Enormous! A cloud of mascarpone cream over sponge, indulgent enough for two to share. Classic, rich, and satisfying.

Service was brisk and professional‚Äîstart to finish in under an hour, making it ideal for a high-quality working lunch. The only minor gripe was the automatic 15% service charge even for bar seating.

One note: the toilets could use an aesthetic refresh to match the otherwise polished surroundings."
Luca,5.0,"Such a fantastic restaurant. The restaurant was beautifully done, such a light space that is really enjoyable to sit in and enjoy your meal. The Al-Fresco dining option also looked perfect for a sunny day. The service was great, the staff were all very attentive without the feeling of trying to rush you out. For starters we got the bread and olive oil, the Parmesan fries, the burrata and pea dish, and the salami/charcuterie style board. All were faultless and I would order them all again. For the mains I got the pork, anchovy and mint ragu pasta - the sauce was tasty and flavourful and the pasta was perfectly made and cooked. I genuinely have no complaints about this restaurant, it was a great meal. I would warn that it is expensive though, expect to spend over ¬£100 so it‚Äôs definitely not an everyday place. I would love to return."
Luca,5.0,"I‚Äôve been wanting to try Luca for quite some time now and it certainly lived up to my high expectations!
We enjoyed the special August Ferragosto Chef‚Äôs menu and loved every dish.
It was a good amount of dishes and a really great way to try many different elements of the a la carte menu plus some options not available a la carte.
We sat in the terrace area and it was such a lovely vibe.
Thank you to the staff for all their friendly service and extra special touches for our birthday celebration."
Luca,5.0,We booked a table for lunch on a Saturday and really enjoyed the experience. The staff were very attentive and the attention to detail was incredible. All the courses came quickly and we were impressed by how calm and intimate the atmosphere was despite almost every table being booked. We were celebrating a birthday and it was definitely a special occasion.
Luca,4.0,I absolutely loved the food here! The cacio e Pepe dish was absolutely incredible and the Parmesan fries were so soft and delicious! The wine bottle we had was gorgeous and I could not recommend this place enough! It was stunning. I did not like the tiramisu though as it was just pure cream which I thought was inauthentic
Luca,5.0,"By far the best Italian restaurant in London. It got a Michelin star for an absolute reason.

The food the perhaps the best I‚Äôve had in my life, especially the Parmesan chips, which are by far the best dish I‚Äôve ever tasted.

For two consecutive visits to London I must say eating at Luca made them better. The rabbit tagliatelle and agnolotti are very recommended.

The wine selection is very good and service is excellent. The atmosphere is not an advantage in my opinion, being too modern.

Go to Luca and have as many Parmesan chips as you possibly can!"
Luca,4.0,"Fine dining without any pretentiousness in a quiet neighborhood on a holiday weekend.
Quite a large space with charming ambiance.
The bread was delicious!"
Luca,5.0,"A fantastic food experience.
I would strongly recommend the chef menu. Fantastic combination of flavours and also great service. Special thanks to Mattia and Luigi for the great service and for walking us through this amazing food/wine journey"
Luca,5.0,Michelin 1 star restaurant. Very vibrant and good business. Services is good. Tiramisu and Afagato both were excellent. Good wine list. Highly recommended.
Luca,5.0,"Had their bar express lunch, exceed my expectations and I‚Äôll for sure come back for their dinner menu!

I liked their Parmesan fries and starter (the green pasta) the most, the right flavour and delicate. The fries do get a bit too heavy if you‚Äôre eating on your own! So best to share it with someone.
The cod is rlly tender but I didn‚Äôt like the sauce much.
The tiramisu SLAYED too, not sweet, very creamy and airy, big portion.

Does get a bit crowded since it‚Äôs a lunchtime during weekdays, but it won‚Äôt be too uncomfortable cuz people are spaced out nicely."
Luca,3.0,"Luca didn't quite live up to the expectations for us. Positives - staff were very really friendly and attentive (and all remembered the special event we had noted in our reservation), the ambiance in the restaurant was wonderful and we enjoyed their cocktails. The melt-in-your-mouth parmesan fries and the burrata set our dinner off to a strong start - the burrata especially had a fantastic contrast of textures and flavours. Sadly the tortellini in crema were overpowered by the cream sauce they were swimming in, making the entire dish monotunous and quickly overwhelming. It then took over 45 minutes to receive our mains. While the staff came over to apologise for our wait, it wasn't a great experience to see our neighbouring table, seated after us, being served much more quickly. When it finally arrived our venison was well cooked, but every component in the dish felt overly salted - even the poached fruit (pears?) which had wonderful spice notes were so salty they failed to balance out the other elements. All in all it took three hours to serve starters, primi and secondi, and we ended up skipping dessert because of it. They proactively removed the parmesan fries (¬£9) and some chocolates they had brought us off the bill, but we rather would have enjoyed our meal at normal pacing."
Luca,5.0,Went here for a birthday meal and was blown away by the staff and food. The one thing I hate about Michelin star places are the portion sizes. They are too small. This place was different and I felt the standard and size of the food delivered. This was my second time here and I will return. Well done Luca.
Luca,4.0,"I enjoyed the atmosphere of Italy in London! Lovely staff especially Lucy was a really warm hearted staff. She gave me a very special and sweet treat for welcoming me! Green pesto pasta was very fresh. Cheese sticks were very cheesy and light texture with softness. And they have a very kind and professional bartender too. Recommend to someone who want to enjoy fresh Italian cuisine. I‚Äôll visit again! (If I remember the wrong name of the staff gave me welcome treatment, I‚Äôm sorry!)"
Luca,5.0,"Really enjoyed the set menu here today. The staff were very attentive with no inclination to rush you through courses. Our waiter Cashel was just fantastic-polite, informative and helpful. Lovely restaurant, great atmosphere and wonderful set menu, all dishes were delicious! Thanks. Have already made another reservation for this lovely restaurant."
Luca,5.0,Me and my partner had her birthday dinner here. Great food especially the lamb and dessert.
Luca,5.0,"Luca Italian Restaurant exceeded all expectations. The service was truly out of the curve‚Äîimpeccable and attentive in every detail. The Italian food is unbelievably good, showcasing the authenticity and craftsmanship behind every dish. I had the ravioli with black truffles, and it was simply crazy good‚Äîone of the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. The environment is equally astonishing, combining elegance with warmth to create the perfect dining atmosphere. It‚Äôs no surprise they earned a Michelin star in 2023; they completely deserve it. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a top-tier Italian dining experience!"
Luca,1.0,"Great staff at the restaurant, good atmosphere, food was below average. It‚Äôs dressed up as a nice restaurant, but the food plays very pedestrian. Reminded me of food on an airplane. Booked in here for a post-engagement dinner. Got severe food poisoning. Had to go to A&E, docs confirmed it was likely from bad seafood. Notified staff, they could not have cared less. Kind of ruined this special occasion. Would not recommend. Beautiful space, but everything else unfortunately was grim."
Luca,5.0,"The tortellini of mortadella with wild garlic broth is amazing. I would recommend it for sure. Besides, burrata and scallops are the highlighted dishes to me. Also good service and ambience."
Luca,4.0,"I booked Luca a few weeks ago, as my mom was in town. First impression: the space is incredible, it‚Äôs designed with such taste, absolute perfection. We ordered champagne to start the evening, which took ages to be served. Staff came twice to apologise. Not sure where they were getting the champagne from but anyway. Starters arrived swiftly, then again, ages to get our main. Staff apologised again. We had a couple on the table next to ours which didn‚Äôt seem to wait for anything, drinks or food, and seem to get extra attention (regulars maybe?), I sound a bit annoyed but it feels slightly weird to have people treated differently in a restaurant. That being said, the food was absolutely incredible. The seafood pasta was especially delicious. The other thing that bothered us was‚Ä¶ the toilet. Weird to mention maybe, but I was expecting toilets as nice as the restaurant, especially in a michelin star restaurant. I had to leave the toilet and come back in to make sure I took the right door. This part hasn‚Äôt been renovated it seems, and most of all it wasn‚Äôt very clean. That‚Äôs a bit of a pity because the food was completely overshadowed by the experience. We stayed almost 2h just for a starter and a main. As much as the food was lovely, I will not come back."
Luca,3.0,"Food was good, think the pasta was not as good as I hoped but not bad by any means.
Scallops changed my life, I think of them every day and absolutely no notes on them.
Vibe of the restaurant was welcoming, cool and fun.
Service was less than desired for a Michelin star and for the price we paid. It wasn‚Äôt terrible, but felt like service you‚Äôd get from the local high street restaurant not a top rated London restaurant. Especially with an automatic 18% tip on the bill for mediocre service."
Luca,4.0,"Had the spring surprise menu - overall, excellent food. Service was friendly but I wouldn‚Äôt say professional - numerous waiters would ask for our drinks order even thought we‚Äôd ordered, food taken away when wasn‚Äôt quite finished. Found the beef disappointing - had asked for medium done, came chewy and well done. Lovely ambience and vibe though."
Luca,4.0,"Lovely restaurant! Delicious food, good service ! The food took a lot of time to get to our table but it was worth it and to be fair they gave us fair warning that it will take atleast 30 -45 minutes to get the food.
We were out in the garden and it was a beautiful day !! Loved the rusty decor and would recommend anyone looking for some good italian to enjoy ! Check out photos of the food!"
Luca,5.0,Great food at this Michelin restaurant. Highly recommend the ribeye.
Luca,5.0,Fantastic place with delicious food and attentive service! All the dishes and desserts were amazing! Highly recommend and will be back!
Luca,4.0,Fantastic starters and excellent food mainly. . Good service - a little too quick between courses. Would have been 5 stars but the pasta was swimming in oil which ruined a great dish. However will definitely return.
Luca,5.0,Great choices and super good service. Attentive menus for different allergies and intolerances. Decor is super nice and understated. Scrumptious food and prices to match
Luca,5.0,"Got the lunch menu twice (shared with someone), everything was overall great. The ham steak was my least favorite, and also the fish, the first courses and desserts were much better. Also the parmesan fries were phenomenal. Overall a very good lunch"
Luca,5.0,"I was there three times and I can say is an amazing Italian food in London.
Detail-oriented, attentive staff, delicious food, deserts and wine list.
I love it!"
Luca,5.0,"It was a last minute visit for lunch. Our flights to France were cancelled so we decided to have a nice lunch. This was a surprisingly, beautifully and deliciously lovely lunch. We enjoyed every course. Service and atmosphere both perfect as well"
Luca,5.0,"Utterly magnificent. I have had the good fortune to eat in thousands of restaurants, nothing beats Luca. Apart from suggesting you start with the exceptional Parmesan fries you should order what you like, everything is amazing. The presentation is superb and the flavours are fresh and complex. Every member of staff seemed one step ahead and made each of us feel valued. Simply astonishing. The lighting, temperature seating and decor was perfect."
Luca,5.0,"Very highly recommended - I'd had this restaurant on my list of places to try for a good few years, and am pleased to say the wait was worth it. Lovely ambiance and decor, superb food, deep Italian wine list, overall an excellent experience."
Luca,5.0,"A more casual Michelin starred restaurant offering really good Italian inspired dishes. The pasta dishes are well balanced and the main courses are on point. There is no doubt you will get food here. My main comment is on the atmosphere, the background music was rock and roll with upbeat tracks. It doesn't go well with the refined high quality dishes in front of you. I'm still giving overall 5 stars because they can easily change the playlist üëç"
Luca,5.0,The restaurant is bigger than it looks with plenty of tables at the back and showing an open kitchen. Service was top notch. And so were the dishes. The bread is made on the day and you can really tell the difference. On the expensive side. The ambience is perfect for a date or even a small gathering.
Luca,5.0,"Good Italian wine selection. Food was extremely well made. Mushroom antipasti and steak were the highlights for me. It‚Äôs on the pricey side but quality of food and service were excellent.

Everything we had was well balanced. Highly recommend you to reserve a slot in their open air area at the back for beautiful way to enjoy LONDON summer day !!"
Luca,5.0,"Quite possibly one of my favorite meals! The atmosphere. Service, and food were all stellar. The food was dynamic and flavorful, keeping its authentic flavors, while not being overly heavy. Portions were very well served. The wine list both by the glass and bottle are interesting, selected thoughtfully, nicely priced and offer a great variety for every palette."
Luca,5.0,"The most amazing Wedding Meal!!!

We dined at Luca in June 2025 for our wedding meal. Beforehand we communicated seamlessly with Silver (who was sensational) and planned our big day.

We ate in the Terrace which was dressed beautifully for us.

Special recognition needs to go to Cameron and his team on the night who's service and attention to detail was the best we have ever experienced.  They really made our evening the most special it could be.

The food is divine, the courses and wine served promptly.

Is this the best restaurant in London?  Most definitely."
Luca,5.0,"It was the second Michelin starred restaurant we tried. We went there for lunch, we were a party of 5 for the bar express menu. Keep in mind they only have tables for 4, so we split our reservation into a group of 3 and 2 of us stayed at the bar, the groups of 2 are always seated at the bar. But we kind of enjoyed this vibe. The drinks are very good and nicely presented. We paired a negroni and a spritz with the parmesan fries which are really interesting. We took the 3 course menu. The appetizer with the jersualem artichoke was to die for, an explosion of tastes left you speechless for a couple of seconds while you tried to figure out what is it exactly you ate. For the mains both of them were very nice, the 3 fishes came with a nice bouillabaisse, a bit almondy for my taste but still it paired nicely. The beef was really tasty and tender for a cut of beef that was not ribeye or fillet. The tiramisu was perfectly executed but the star of dessert was the Panna Cotta with rhubarb. Would gladly return here to try the full tasting menu"
Luca,4.0,"We had a fun date night here but it wasn‚Äôt quite up to the level we felt its reputation and long standing establishment would suggest. Good ingredients and some excellent dishes (the rib eye and tiramisu were excellent - the pastas less so).

The service meanwhile started well as we were obligingly given, after requesting, a better table that was sitting empty, in a far from full restaurant. But then it promptly disappeared thanks to a permanently uninterested waitress, eye rolling at all customers when she thought no-one was looking. It was an insult to both the customers and the restaurant itself. Awkward and uncomfortable."
Luca,5.0,Spent my birthday having lunch at Luca. The Parmesan Fries and Roast Orkney Scallops are must-orders. The whole staff were very friendly and accommodating but special shoutout to Ida who provided world-class service. Will definitely be back soon.
Luca,3.0,"Had high expectations given the Michelin star but was fairly disappointed.

The chefs menu was a strange combination of dishes (burrata for starters and then stracciatella as primi) and not their most inspiring sounding dishes. The primi was well plated but very bland and flavourless and the dessert was probably nowhere near as nice as the other options on the menu (we saw the other desserts on other tables). Nothing was actively wrong with the food, aside from being overpriced.

The service was quite rushed (drinks were almost taken away before finishing etc) and not especially friendly. We could hardly hear what was on out plates. Also no one asked to take our coats or double checked on allergies etc.

Overall: the restaurant is very nicely decorated and the food is not bad but for the price I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôd recommend it."
Luca,5.0,"I‚Äôd go as far as saying Luca is my favourite winter restaurant in London. Been many times now and the food is always amazing. Cater to my gluten, dairy, egg free diet perfectly. If you can dine on a week day be sure to book the set menu in the bar area ( ask for a booth) brilliant value for money!"
Luca,5.0,"From the moment I stepped into this hidden gem on 88 St John Luca, I knew I was in for something special. The atmosphere is effortlessly elegant, blending modern charm with a cozy warmth that instantly makes you feel at home. But the real magic? It's on the plate.

Every dish was a masterpiece  beautifully presented, bursting with flavor, and crafted with precision. The ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality. I tried the Parmesan Fries and was absolutely blown away it was a symphony of taste.

The service was impeccable. Attentive without being intrusive, the staff made me feel like a VIP from start to finish. They knew the menu inside out and offered perfect recommendations tailored to my tastes.

This place doesn‚Äôt just serve food  it delivers an experience. Whether you're a local or just visiting London, 88 St John Luca is a must-visit. I left not only full, but inspired. Easily one of the best dining experiences I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôll be back soon  and bringing friends."
Luca,5.0,"A great way to celebrate a special occasion, the food goes between good and amazing, the staff is patient, polite and very accommodating.
The tasting menu is good value and the wine list has a good selection and is reasonably priced.
We also received a surprise from the chefs, to celebrate the occasion, thank you!"
Luca,5.0,"We went there for lunch and opted for the bar express menu. Even though it was a Michelin starred restaurant, we went there without any expectation as we were opting for the more ‚Äúquick and budget-friendly‚Äù lunch option. The quality of the food was superb considering the price of the 3-course meal (¬£30). The fried Jerusalem artichoke dish was so flavourful and imo the best dish we had that day. The main was slightly underwhelming considering both the starters were great. Bavette steak was quick chewy but I would assume it‚Äôs due to the choice of cut as meat was cooked to the perfect medium rare temperature as seen in picture. Service was good - the staff were attentive. Overall, it was an enjoyable dining experience  at Luca."
Luca,4.0,The food there is amazing but towards the salty side the atmosphere is relatively good towards the end of the night can be a little bit noisy. There are two dining parts one is close to the bar when it‚Äôs in the main area. I‚Äôd recommend the main area.
Luca,5.0,"This place is immense. Best value for money that I know of in London right now. I had the bar menu tasting menu which was basically three courses for ¬£30. Food this good usually costs a lot more.

Paid extra for bread then had Malfadine pasta and artichokes for starters. Then steak for the main. Followed by pano cotta and tiramisu.

All the dishes were superb. Especially the presentation but the taste was great too. The artichoke glaze was something else.

The steak was rich in flavour and had great texture. It was cooked well and gave many an mmmm moment. The onions were interestingly presented and were a great accompaniment to the meat.

The cocktails and wine were great too.

The food is excellent value. The drinks are on the pricey side bur generally only in relation to the food. Compared to other restaurants of this calibre they‚Äôre totally in line.

Will definitely go again. This place is a hidden gem. Go there before they put the prices up."
Luca,5.0,Hands down the best food in London. Everything was so well presented and tasted out of this world. The service was impeccable to match. We had the pleasure of chatting with Nancy and Christina (I hope I got the spelling right) and they made the experience so memorable. Highly recommended.
Luca,5.0,"Some of the best Italian we‚Äôve had outside of Italy. We shared several different plates with a table of four so got to try several different plates and all of them were done perfectly and with beautiful presentation. Our server Amy was friendly and fun, and super knowledgeable about the menu. Michelin quality food with family feeling service.

Our favorites on the menu were the monkfish crudo, the halibut, and the pasta with rabbit. 6 stars! Would absolutely come back."
Luca,5.0,"Lovely elegant restaurant in a quiet area in Clerkenwell.

Initially it looks like a little quiet bar, but after you pass the bar area towards the back, they have an amazing dinning area. I‚Äôm really impressed with the space and design.

Apart from the tables, they also have 3 rooms which you can reserve for large groups including an outdoor seating section.

The food is delicious and neatly presented, they also serve cocktails and have a lovely selection of wines.

The staff is welcoming and helpful, I was very happy to have finally visited."
Luca,5.0,"Took my mom for an early Mother‚Äôs Day lunch. The restaurant and the staff exceeded my expectations. The service was impeccable, attentive but not excessive. Food was incredible. The atmosphere with soft lighting, very ambient music in the background that allowed to hear each other. Great suggestions from the staff. My mom was made to feel very special. I highly recommend Luca to anyone, for a special occasion or otherwise. I hope to return soon, thank you all so much for giving us such a memorable experience. Best staff! Best food! I will be recommending this to anyone looking for a special venue, great staff and exquisite food."
Luca,5.0,"Best Italian in London! I think Luca has one the best ingredients among London Italian restaurants - the only competition is River Cafe. Just look at the color of the olives, the bean, the pastas. They are all very fresh, and about the best one would find anywhere. We have many favorite Italian restaurants in London. But none of them is comparable in term of ingredients. They maybe good at different format of cooking,  but not ingredients. I‚Äôm very much enjoyed everything we ordered, from bread, olive oil (which is so good that I asked if I can buy some bottles from Luca), scallops, pastas and the dessert.
I also like the vented high ceiling and proper decor. Not over the top, but proper high end Italian setting."
Luca,5.0,"I booked the ‚ÄòPasta Room‚Äô here for my proposal, and had a 7 course Prix Fixe Menu.

Shannon from the bookings team was helpful and always at hand to answer queries and relay messages.

Anastasia was our waitress and the general manager (whose name I‚Äôve sadly forgotten, sorry!) were fantastic throughout the whole evening. Being in a private dining room made the experience so much more intimate, and at no point did we feel like we were forgotten or lacking service.

The food was stunning. I‚Äôd go back in a heartbeat."
Luca,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. We got the lunch express menu, and each course was well-thought out and delicious. Even the bread we got at a starter felt unique and tasted amazing. My trout was very tender and the warm tartar sauce was tangy and paired well with the fish. The portions were good size and I felt full afterwards. The pannacotta dessert was a little too sour but the tiramisu was perfect."
Luca,5.0,Absolutely amazing meal. Incredible food and great staff. Highly recommend sitting outside for great ambiance. Taglierini of Cornish lobster dish was divine. Also recommend the ribeye. Only little disappointment was the lamb - very expensive for the serving size and nothing exceptional. But would definitely go back!!
Luca,5.0,I dined at the bar and had a great experience. The staff were lovely and shout out to the two women running front of house who were attentive and kind! Highly recommend the Parmesan fries and the ravioli. Wish I had room for dessert!
Luca,4.0,"The food is great and the atmosphere is really nice. We got the chef menu, the fish crudo, the burrata and the tortellini were our favourite. The pork was delicious but I think by the time we got to the pork we were already really full, and then followed by a really heavy chocolate dessert. I think in terms of menu logic, it would‚Äôve been smarter to finish off with something lighter or more acidic to cut off the fattiness of the pork. We had a great night, but this meal definitely felt overpriced, the ingredients are fresh and probably seasonal but with that price we expected a bit more expensive ingredients."
Luca,5.0,"The atmosphere of the restaurant was amazing. We had a quick drink at the waiting area and then we moved to the dinning room. The waiters were very friendly and professional. We were impressed by the food and the portions were sufficient.

We would recommend this restaurant, especially for a special occasion!!!"
Luca,3.0,"The spacious, soft inviting glow interior of Luca exudes stylish, subtle elegance that's far removed from stuffy formality ‚Äî setting the backdrop for an enjoyable meal. It‚Äôs the kind of spot where you can linger over your food and conversation without feeling rushed. Service was on point, the staff knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing, ensuring dishes arrived at an ideal pace with the exception of the bill.

The evening began with a familiar opening act: bread and olive oil. The bread, still faintly warm from the oven, featured a crusty exterior and a pillowy interior, practically begging to be dipped into the olive oil. A simple combination to start. The parmesan fries were just delightful. Golden, crispy, and generously dusted with parmesan. They danced dangerously between churro and cheesy indulgence. A truly addictive starter.

The monkfish crudo, however, was a misstep. The combination of flavors didn‚Äôt quite gel, and the monkfish's texture was slightly rubbery, lacking the succulence expected in a crudo. The salad of italian and british seasonal leaves was refreshingly simple yet satisfying, highlighted by fresh and high-quality greens.

The rigatoni with pork sausage rag√π was a bolder affair. The pasta was cooked al dente, though I did find the ragu to pasta ratio a bit off. Some strands of rigatoni were ragu-less, while others were swimming in it. Nevertheless, the rag√π itself was flavorful with a precise balance of meat, tomato, and spice.

Then came the off-menu truffle tagliolini cacio e pepe. The moment the waiter uttered ""truffle,"" I was sold and I couldn‚Äôt resist. The pasta was cooked to perfection, the cacio rich and creamy, and the truffle shavings truly generous. It transported me straight to the upper echelon of the pasta world.

While Luca offers many delights and is undoubtedly a destination for pasta lovers, it's not without a few minor hiccups. But when a dish hits the mark, it truly resonates- you just need to find them."
Luca,5.0,"It's been such a long time since I have had dinner at 9pm. (only booking we could get last moment in the weeks leading up to Christmas.)

Now to the important part, OMG this place is amazing. I'm not a high end foodie so I may not be able to do this place justice in terms of description.
But the food is amazing, the variety, the tastes, the quality - it all matched up to be a beautiful meal. (silly way to explain how good it was but food made with love.)"
Luca,5.0,"Such an amazing restaurant, traditional Italian comfort food but make it classy. Went with a couple of friend and we got seated in a very lovely location. The bread was stunning, and the wine selection really good too!"
Luca,5.0,"Lunch here was great - we started of with the potato sourdough from the dusty knuckle paired with some Sicilian olive oil. Parmesan fries were a lovely starter paired with some wine. These were Parmesan fries that were piped into the fryer (if that makes sense). Starters: sea bass crudo and burrata, which was both extremely refreshing for a spring day. We had the cacio e pepe cappelletti with white asparagus & morels and mezzi paccheri with pork ragu and a hint of mint, both were delicious. Then shared a Scottish halibut at the end, which we thought was a generous portion of fish and also perfectly cooked. Lemon tart and fennel ice cream was also a great choice to end the meal. Big shout out to Yda, who gave us recommendations, greeted us with a lovely smile and her cheerful attitude for the whole afternoon."
Luca,4.0,"The place is really nice. The food was a mixed bag. The nduja scallops were divine but the truffle ravioli, mushroom pasta, and tiramisu were just ok. The ravioli dish was quite sweet for my taste and felt very overpriced for ¬£48."
Luca,3.0,"My friend recommended we come here due to the good reviews, as we thought we'd have a go!
We had the veggie set menu and everything was delicious, but seemed incredibly expensive compared to other (better) restaurants I've been to. If you've got money to burn, please go. If you don't, there are much better restaurants for similar/cheaper.
The staff were super friendly as well, explained everything and you felt as though you could ask them anything."
Luca,5.0,"Luca
a phenomenal restaurant from start to finish.
it is rare that I ever give 5 stars to a restaurant. it is even rare I give 4 stars.
in this case, it is an easy 5.

I‚Äôll start with the decor, the place is simply stunning, giving you a feeling of a high end restaurant in Sicily.
Staff were exceptional. very attentive and knowledgeable. excellent wine selection and a phenomenal sommelier (who‚Äôs also the GM and looked after us the whole evening) - Stephan.

we were 2 and ordered 9 dishes and 5 desserts. ofc, all staff members were shocked. but we‚Äôve had to try. we don‚Äôt go east often. plus, this is how we roll.

I‚Äôll start with the phenomenal bread which is made by a separate bakery and it is simply phenomenal. accommodating throughout the whole meal, as you dip the bread and the mouthwatering genius sauces.
their Sicilian olive oil is to die for. how can an olive oil be this exceptional?

the parmesan fries were to die for. such thin batter that melts in your mouth, made me think - how the hell it didn‚Äôt break frying it!
the Monk fish starter was probably one of the best dishes of the night. so as the burrata with the fig, beetroot and hazelnut. both dishes had multiple textures and flavors accumulating throughout. seconds after you took the bite.
the scallops were boring and I‚Äôd avoid ordering.

we‚Äôve had 3 pastas, the Rabbit Tagliatelle was good but missing salt.
the Cappelletti and Tortelli were both amazing. empowering and full of flavor.

The lamb was made to perfection but had too many things on the plate. so I‚Äôd simply would of had just the lamb with the goats curd and would of found the dish perfect. everything else took away for the perfectly cooked meat.
the halibot was great but nothing exceptional.

all 5 desserts were amazing. very light and simply accurate.

I would avoid the mains and focus on the Anti Pasti, Primi and desserts."
Luca,5.0,"Me and my sister had an amazing lunch at Luca, celebrating our birthdays! We had the chef‚Äôs menu of 2 antipasto to share, primo, secondo e dolce. It was all amazing, especially bucatini and tiramisu. Very fast and smart service. I absolutely recommend this location. Thank you!!"
Luca,5.0,"This restaurant is up there with the best in London in my opinion. The food is delicious (favourites included the John Dory and the Stone Bass) but the team are also both on-point and so friendly. We sat at / enjoyed the counter but the other three areas (kitchen area; ‚Äúmain‚Äù room, outside space) all looked great. Special shoutout to Alessandro and the bartenders, Will and Cashel - thank you for making our evening so special."
Luca,5.0,"Really lovely restaurant about 20 min walk from Liverpool Street. Very unassuming from the outside but opens up when you walk through. Very good service. Not sure if they have a sommelier, no one offered to talk us through the wine list or make recommendations. I had a cocktail which was tasty and well made . Water was continually topped up including sparkling water. We opted for the chefs menu, so the chef chooses the food they serve you. The catered for different allergens . The different waiters did say what the food was but was very quietly spoken so did not always hear. Our main server was very attentive and kind. The napkins were very fluffy and left white bobbles on both mine and my husbands trousers that did not brush off easy. Overall very tasty food especially the parmesan fries and a very good service."
Luca,3.0,"For a restaurant bearing a Michelin star, the experience left much to be desired. The evening was marred by a pervasive sense of being hurried, an unfortunate distraction.

The service, while polite, lacked finesse. From the moment we were seated, there was a noticeable rush: plates were cleared before we‚Äôd finished, mains arrived prematurely, and even our request for a few minutes to discuss the wine was interrupted by an eager inquiry for our food order. Feedback offered to the staff was met not with reflection, but rather with ‚Äúthe pasta must be eaten hot‚Äù, a response that, while technically correct, misses the larger point about guest experience.

Among the mains, the pistachio tortellini was the standout. In contrast, the rigatoni with pork sausage rag√π was forgettable, lacking depth - in my opinion any household in Italy would have done it better.

The highlight of the evening, without question, was the wine. The sommelier was very gracious too.

At this price point, we definitely expected more. Sadly, this visit failed to deliver."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Speedboat Bar has nailed the basics - a concise one pager menu and food with fresh and bold flavours. I only ordered the Tom Yam Mama Noodles as a main and it was fantastic. The right amount of heat and depth of flavour until the last spoonful. Pork was crispy on the outside and tender. I also tried the crispy chicken skins. They were indeed very crispy and flavourful, making you want more. The pineapple pie with taro ice-cream was a fantastic end, crispy pastry and caramelised pineapple inside."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"We visited the Speedboat Bar and really enjoyed the experience. The atmosphere felt very authentic, both in terms of the food and the interior design. The service was friendly and welcoming, which added to the overall positive impression. We sat upstairs, which was a nice spot, though it was quite loud and made conversation a bit difficult. The menu offered good options, but the selection for vegetarians was somewhat limited. One thing to note: the Pad Krapao was extremely spicy ‚Äî so be prepared if you order it! Overall, a great place with authentic vibes and tasty food ‚Äì just be prepared for a lively, noisy setting."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Food and drinks were great!! I am obsessed with Tom yum mama noodles and regularly have the instant version at home so this boujee version was fantastic!! The fried rice was very flavoursome and even better with the sauces! Pour the beef tongue curry sauce on it and it‚Äôs even better! The pineapple pie was a nice way to end the meal
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"The place looks like old bangkok which is lovely. The staff were friendly and attentive. I had the most awesome time eating, i think they have the best tom yum mama in town, it‚Äôs so rich and filling. Id definitely go back :)"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Food all overpriced and small portions
Ridiculous small size tom yum mama noodle price ¬£29 but it is just taste same as Thai brand mama instant noodles which you can buy around ¬£1.....the crispy pork in it is not crispy and meat is dry.   Morning glory is excellent, salad taste authentic. The invoice said there is OPTIONAL donation and OPTIONAL 13.5% service charge, but I dont see there is any option. Overall not nice experience."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"I had a great Sunday lunch here! The food was outstanding, bursting with authentic flavors.

The decor is fantastic‚Äîit really transported me to a local restaurant in Thailand. Upstairs, the bar has a cool retro vibe that I absolutely loved.

The food leans on the saltier side, but I didn‚Äôt mind since I paired it with their delicious green tea‚Äîsweet, milky, and just right. My only complaint is the price; they charge ¬£6 for the tea, which, with service charges, could probably get me ten of them in Thailand.

For starters, we had the pork belly‚Äîcrispy and packed with flavor‚Äîalong with a chicken salad that was tangy and had a fun crunch from the crispy bits. The fried rice was well-seasoned and far beyond your average dish. The beef tongue curry was tasty but a little too oily for my liking. Still, everything was incredibly satisfying!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"One of the most unique Thai restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to. The food was super flavorful, a bit spicy but not unbearable and really well rounded. The tongue and tendon curry is what I had and it was amazing! Very tasty crispy pork as a snack, the chicken skins also were so tasty. Can‚Äôt forget to mention the sweet corn fritters which amazingly well with an ice cold draft Singha. Can‚Äôt forget to mention the margarita which was super unique and unlike any cocktail I‚Äôve ever had. Little bit spicy, not too sweet, not too sour and a good dosage of booze ;). Would recommend!!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Had to see what the hype was about and honestly I think it‚Äôs worth it!! Really amazing flavours and authentic to Thai roots. It‚Äôs London pricing of course so I‚Äôve seen some folks upset by the portion size for price, and I think that‚Äôs a valid criticism.

We had crispy pork to start, super delicious, melts in your mouth and the spicy sauce that comes on the side was awesome.

We also tried cellophane noodles with chicken, beef noodles and fried rice. Everything was spectacular flavour wise so I‚Äôd gladly go back!

It‚Äôs a small place so highly recommend making a reservation."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Really good food and friendly service. We ordered the chicken skins, corn fritters, fried rice and beef tongue and tendon curry. All were delicious and authentic. The atmosphere of this restaurant was great and almost like being transported to Thailand."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,More flash than substance. Some dishes were good while others like the cellophane noodles didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark (bland and lacked flavour). Was a bit pricey for what was served. Service was great - friendly and fast. The wine list was small and expensive. The cava was full of sediment and wasn‚Äôt great; you‚Äôre better off ordering wine or beer with your meal.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"One of those places that you stumble on and turns out to be absolutely fantastic.

The service was top notch, fast and efficient.

The Tom Yum noodles with crispy pork, prawns & squid is the best I‚Äôve ever tasted.

By far the best food I‚Äôve had this year."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Food was very yummy and hit the spot. We had a curry, fried fish, rice and crispy pork and it was the perfect amount for two people. The food was a bit overpriced but that‚Äôs London. Atmosphere was great but we came at 3 and it wasn‚Äôt very busy so I understand it may change when it hits 7"
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"I don‚Äôt really understand why this restaurant has such high ratings, the food is average, nothing particular amazing despite we ordered their most popular dishes. They are definitely overpriced for the portion.

The minced beef with holy basil was way too salty and overpowered the actual flavour of the ingredients, portion quite small and have to order rice separately.

Tom Yam noodles dish was very picturesque but it tasted exactly like the instant mama noodles shrimp flavour, except creamier and more sour. The exact same noodles as the instant noodles, given the price I felt ripped off. However I enjoyed the chunky pork bellies, prawns and meat balls, egg yolk, the toppings were my favourite. The ingredients don‚Äôt blend together though, felt like each ingredient was cooked separately. Using instant noodles in a dish is a big no for me, tasted too much like instant noodles I have all the time."
Speedboat Bar,1.0,"I had a poor experience at Speedboat Bar and would not recommend it. Despite the buzz around this venue, my visit left much to be desired in terms of food quality, service, and overall ambience.

Venue & Atmosphere:
The interior attempts to echo the feel of a lower-end Thai eatery, with dated d√©cor including a worn carpeted staircase and nostalgic photos of Thai street food stalls and the Thai monarchy. There are about 16 tables inside, with a few more outside and upstairs. The upstairs section has more seating, a bar, a pool table, and two unisex toilets. Tables are crammed closely together, and the lack of sound insulation means you‚Äôre clearly overhearing conversations from adjacent tables. The ambience is chaotic and uncomfortable‚Äîparticularly awkward as diners have to shift around when others leave due to space constraints. Best suited for a group of 4; smaller tables are impractical.

Drinks:
A decent selection of Thai beers like Singha and Leo, alongside some interesting cocktails and Thai iced coffee/tea. This was probably the highlight of the visit.

Food (Tasting Menu): Yaowarat Road Set Menu (¬£36pp)
Unfortunately, the food was a letdown across the board:
‚Ä¢ Chicken skin with Zaep seasoning: Overwhelmingly salty and spicy, with what tasted like a heavy dose of MSG. The skin was tough and the meat quality poor.
‚Ä¢ Chicken match with green mango: Unbalanced‚Äîcloyingly sweet and overly sour. The tamarind was overpowering.
‚Ä¢ Sweetcorn fritters: Extremely average and forgettable.
‚Ä¢ Stir-fried morning glory: Again, just average‚Äînothing stood out.
‚Ä¢ Minced beef with basil: Poor quality meat in an overpowering sauce.
‚Ä¢ Crispy pork curry: This dish had a vaguely sweet rendang-like sauce but was let down by fatty, low-quality pork belly. It was hard to find much actual meat.Large amounts were wasted due to the large amounts of  meat fat.

Value for Money:
The tasting menu came to ¬£72, but when pricing up the individual dishes, it amounted to about ¬£63. This wouldn‚Äôt have mattered if the food quality had been good‚Äîbut given the lack of balance in flavour, poor quality meat, no dessert included, and overall disappointing experience, it felt like poor value.

Service:
Service was indifferent. Dishes were dropped at the table without explanation, and staff seemed disengaged. When we raised concerns about the inedible chicken skin, we were told nothing could be substituted as it was a set menu. The manager simply reiterated this, showing no flexibility or empathy. There was no effort to remedy the situation.

Overall:
Below-average ambience, poor service, and subpar food with questionable meat quality and unbalanced flavours. Disappointing on almost every front. I‚Äôd advise avoiding this spot if you‚Äôre after a pleasant Thai dining experience in London."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Great food, staff were friendly and service was fast. Upstairs is mainly for drinks and has a pool table. Not sure if you have to pay to play, didn‚Äôt ask üôÇ
Anyways food was the most amazing Thai food. The shrimp ceviche was spicy and to die for."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Very tasty Thai food. Not a big menu, so you may not have a lot of choice though. I had a vegetarian curry and it was delicious. Very popular so reservation is advised."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Setup is authentic, gives you the Thai street food feel for sure but at a 10x higher price tag. Had their specialty tomyam noodle soup with pork, prawn, squid and meatballs which was very nice but definitely not worth ¬£29. Every one of their dishes essentially contain the same crispy pork belly, but just a variation of it.
Cocktail are OK and so was the service."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Good Thai and Asian dishes that you don't usually get elsewhere. The pineapple pie is to die for.

The bill became quite steep at lunch simply for 2, as portion sizes are quite small. The fried morning glory doesn't quite hit the spot and feels like it's missing a bit of seasoning - understandable though as they're catering for western palates.

Would definitely come back another time to try the beer tower!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Food tasted better than expected. Excellent taste! The staff were helpful and friendly.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Speedboat Bar, how much did I love thee? It was so good I came back twice on the same night. While London is so much better for foodies, the Asian flavours are still somewhat toned down and a little bland in several places. After a week in town, I was craving flavours that are more assertive and true to SE Asian cuisines and this place delivered in spades. My mouth was so happy!! The restaurant doesn‚Äôt have a spiciness scale so if you can‚Äôt handle lots of garlic and chilies, you may want to read the descriptions more carefully or ask the staff which dishes are less spicy.

All photos are dishes I ate in the restaurant - pork belly and prawn ceviche (first trip) and the sausage and mustard greens (second trip). Dishes I ordered to go are the phad see ew (which sadly I had to let go since I couldn‚Äôt keep it while watching a show even though I‚Äôm not planning on eating it) and the naem fried rice, which I ordered to go the second time I came back. Tip: If you get the mustard greens and the naem fried rice, pour the leftover sauce from the pickled greens on top of the fried rice. You‚Äôre welcome!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"SUCH a Cool place and great quality and authentic Thai food, decor transports you back to the 90s in Thailand. There‚Äôs free pool upstairs, it‚Äôs a whole vibe. The prawn ceviche was amazing (but on the spicier side) and the salted duck egg + anchovy option was wild but didn‚Äôt regret it! also got the Tom yum which is more pricey but could be shared between 2 people and highly recommend but it was the star of the show. Like wow. Cocktails and other drinks are delicious and decent options but maybe they could do a creamy pina colada option to cool my mouth after all those spices! But the ice tea did the trick x"
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Very authentic, Thai experience in Central London.
Food was good but I guess it could have been a bit better. A bit too greasy for me.
I recommend sitting upstairs as the vibe is a bit better but overall entire place has nice, thai decor."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We were staying very close to this restaurant and were looking forward to dine here. The reservation seemed excessive but didn't want to take a chance. The restaurant itself is worth the hype. You are transported to Thailand food streets and in the most wonderful way. We tried a bunch of things and everything was top notch. Our favorite were the naemh fried rice, ooh delicious and the flat noodles, banging! Highly recommend to anyone in London looking for great food ."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"I was quite excited to try Speedboat Bar because of the positive reviews. The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty basic, service is okay nothing exceptional yet there is 13.5% service charge. The food is delicious, however the portions are so small for the amount of money you pay and it is safe to say you can leave the restaurant still feeling hungry. The experience overall felt like a rip off. What I found frustrating as well is that nowhere in the menu they have specified how spicy each dish is and you may end up ordering something that you cannot eat just because of how hot it is."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"At the time of writing, this is probably the best Thai food that I have had in London. The restaurant itself does feel like you could be in Bangkok, down to the Muay Thai fights being shown on the televisions. The food was all excellent, perfectly balanced between spicy, sweet and sour. We tried the chicken skins (something I am amazed has not become more popular in the UK), crispy pork, mustard greens with Chinese sausage (which was maybe a rogue choice but may have been my favourite dish), beef tongue curry, pad krapao (with a fried egg, of course), and morning glory. Will definitely be back."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Just one of the very best thai meals I had in London. Hands down.
Went with my missus for our anniversary and we were mesmerized. Can‚Äôt recommend this enough. Honest prices and great service as well, can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"We were asked if we were done 3 times by the staff whilst staying there for about an hour. Visibly we had food left on the plates and were still eating. There were 3 empty tables around us. I got the impression that they wanted us to leave quickly.
Had Tom yum, chicken with green mango kerabu, Tom yum noodles and fried fish fillet. Chicken and fish were both really salty and needed hefty rice to eat with, but generally flavourful."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Love Plaza Khao Gaeng so when I heard this place was run by the same people I had to visit.

Fantastic! Everything we ordered was bursting with flavor. Highly recommend coming here if you like Thai food."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Amazing! One of the best Thai places I‚Äôve been in London. Every dish was so tasty. If you‚Äôre not afraid of some offal I highly recommend the beef tongue and tendons, super fatty and delicious. The crispy chicken skins are also a must to start!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Food was fantastic, incredibly tasty. The atmosphere made you feel like you were right in the heart of Bangkok. I would highly recommend a visit."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Speed Boat Bar, Chinatown London
I've got high hopes and am really looking forward to this place! There are a lot of choices around Chinatown, but I wanted to give it a try!
They were fully booked and seemed very popular but, given my name on the waiting list, it took 30 mins as they turned table very quickly. It has great vibes in the seating area downstairs. It's a complex menu and reasonably priced if compared in London. We didn't drink alcohol but tried Thai Tea, which was okay. They looked nice but nothing special. The food was good, but some of the dishes had too much spice and way too salty! I didn't like the pork snack at all. The taste was weird (it is much better without the sour taste!!) Tomyum noodles in the hotpot (¬£29) looked fantastic but a little too much spice in them! But the ingredients were top quality! The bill was ¬£100 which is usually the price of 2 anyway. Very good and friendly service. Hopefully I will be back for cocktails and shots with Minced Beef With Holy Basil and rice. Check it out if you're in this area! Thank you."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,A very authentic Thai experience here in London. The waitress was amazing and we really did enjoy our food which was a tounge curry(pretty spicy) and a fried rice. Would eat here again when back in London.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Lives up to the hype. Incredible food, we loved everything we ate. To balance the spice get the Jelly Bia cocktail (it was surprisingly so tasty!) we dangerously could‚Äôve eat an entire bag of the crispy chicken skins lol. We loved the Tom Yum soup w squid prawns and giant slices of crispy pork belly. YUM!"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Food: The food was tasty, but we were a bit disappointed with the small portion sizes.

Service: The staff were friendly, but there wasn‚Äôt much service beyond taking our order and bringing water/bill. They didn‚Äôt come to check if the food was okay etc.

Price: Considering the small portions and minimal service, we found the prices to be quite overpriced. On top of that, a 13.5% service charge was added to the bill (higher than the normal 12.5% service charge in London), along with a ¬£1 charity donation‚Äîsomething we hadn‚Äôt encountered before in London and elsewhere.

Atmosphere: The decor is very Thai-inspired, and the space appears to have been converted from an English pub. There‚Äôs even a pool table upstairs, which is quite interesting. Most of the customers were Westerners; we barely saw any East Asian diners - the above probably explains why."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"Having lived in Thailand for around 20 years, we were very disappointed in the food.

It wasn‚Äôt bad, but it really didn‚Äôt taste authentic. The flavours were just not right.

Find it hard to believe that it was made by Thai people.

Service was professional and friendly."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Service was good and efficient however I wasn‚Äôt blown away from the food. We ordered chicken skins however they were very spicy to the point it ruined our mains, we weren‚Äôt even informed that they were spicy on the menu. The main courses were just average in my opinion, I did like the pad see ew, the Thai tea that we ordered tasted watery. Overall disappointing and pricey, not really authentically Thai. Would not return."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"The restaurant offers pretty typical Thai food and it tastes good. However, the menu is quite small and the portions are not very big. The wait time for a table is ~10 mins and the average price per head is ¬£26/person without a drink."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Excellent authentic Thai food that doesn't pull its punches when it comes to spice (be warned). The cocktails were very good as well.

My only gripe was that it was quite expensive for what it is - maybe I'm spoiled by my local Thai eatery but this place was almost twice the price (although I suppose there is a Soho premium).

All in all, very worthwhile a visit."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Best Thai place in London. Avoid if you cannot handle your spice as they are not joking. The cocktails are also very nice and the Thai ice tea is a 10/10. Also, make sure to order the Chicken Skin as appetiser."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Service was quick and attentive, and the atmosphere felt relaxed, almost like a casual caf√©. We ordered chicken skin, morning glory, beef tongue curry, crispy pork curry, and a noodle dish. I can‚Äôt say it felt completely authentic, but everything was tasty enough that we finished it all.

I do agree with some of the earlier comments about the food being on the salty side and the portions feeling a little small for the price. Overall, I‚Äôm glad we gave it a try, but I think I‚Äôd lean towards local spots that haven‚Äôt been so heavily reviewed and hyped by London food critics."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"This is my second visit to this restaurant, and I still love the ambiance because it feels just like being in Thailand. They offer beer towers and authentic Thai dishes that are delicious and packed with strong flavors, but the portions are quite small for the price. It‚Äôs on the expensive side, but it‚Äôs fine for occasional visits. I recommend it if you‚Äôre looking for an authentic Thai food."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Thought this was 'good' but not 'great'. Good: because the food was generally tasty, reasonable value, good atmosphere. But missed out on being 'great' as a lot of the dishes were fairly simple and not massively innovative - e.g. minced beef with spices and a fried egg. I thought the fried chicken skins, which people rave about, just tasted like pork scratchings.

The cocktails were great though, other than the negroni which wasn't especially different to a normal negroni.

I see a lot of reviews worry about levels of spice. I thought it was fine (as a Brit!) although the curry was definitely at the upper end of my tolerance level.

Unusually I thought the dessert was the best course and I would definitely recommend the taro ice cream option."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,I recently visited with a partner the restaurant for a dinner. I booked a table ahead of time as tables go quickly. A big downside for me was the layout of the tables where basically you are sharing your table with some strangers ( who actually came in sick). All of the dishes were tasty however I found that some of the dishes had too much of spice. It would be great if the menu adopted a scale of spiciness. The biggest highlight of this restaurant is the superb dessert with taro ice cream. I will surely return here only to enjoy that delicious dessert!
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Most impressive crispy pork ever‚Ä¶!! It is first slow cooked then the skin is made crispy‚Ä¶ fine dining level of preparation. Crispy skin with melt-in-your-mouth experience.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Really enjoyed it. My third time here and London heatwave made me think I could almost be in Thailand! Service was good and friendly. Food was good although I thought the beef stir-fry was quite salty (and I like my salt) and the fish over cooked. I know it was deep fried but wonder whether it was reheated - it was very crunchy. The aubergine was my favourite and I really liked the prawn 'ceviche'. Will definitely return. Love the atmosphere and spice levels!
Speedboat Bar,1.0,"We had:
Beef tongue curry: not much flavour other than a tinge of curry taste, one-dimensional taste and nothing interesting about it, meat was 60% fats
Morning glory: super sweet and salty
Crispy pork: perhaps the only saving grace but still pretty average
Crispy chicken skin: very salty
Rice: dry

Portions were very small, food came very cold and we waited more than 30ish mins for the food. Appreciate the staff who found us a table despite visiting with no reservation. Atmosphere was not that bad, interesting deco but we were seated on the same table as the couple who were constantly making out lol. Hence, overall a very unpleasant and disturbing experience for us."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Amazing varied dishes with a good kick to them! Place is packed and you can see why! gluten free options are available but not all dishes
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Loved the food here, specially the tom yum but also the place is designed and curated to perfection to remind you of a local Bangkok bar - great lighting, attention to all details, every corner will remind you of Bangkok"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"everything we ordered was amazing! The restaurant was full of people, it was a fun, loose atmosphere, we really enjoyed ut and would absolutely visit again!"
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"Overhyped restaurant which I‚Äôm unsure how it‚Äôs sustaining its rating.

We tried the ‚Äúset menu‚Äù which was shockingly bad. The chicken skins, as others mentioned, were served cold and can easily chip a tooth. Out of the food that comes with the set menu 3/5 are intensely spicy with no ability of the restaurant to module the heat. We ordered a Tom Yam on the side which was one of the only things we could eat‚Ä¶

Cocktails were average, service was average, and overall not value for money if you look at the price tag. I would not recommend this restaurant."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"An amazing find. I realize its a popular place. Went there with friends and tried a whole variety of dishes. Every dish was special and tasted amazing. Highly recommend going there.
For a fun citrus drink, definitely try the calamansi drink."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Enjoyed the food, but the portion sizes didn‚Äôt quite justify the price."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Service is nothing short of incredible.   We arrived an hour early and took a chance to ask if we could move our slot in which they obliged without issue. Most restaurants tend to rush you with ordering and getting out, not here, the waitress took time to help choose and explain the cocktails and suggestions on food.
Fish balls, chicken skins and the noodles were absolutely amazing and will be back for those again.
I do love a good holy basil stir fry, and would say this was the only dish that was a slight let down on taste.  Other than that 10/10."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"I was surprised that all the dishes were smaller than I expected.
In the country where I live, I‚Äôve never seen such small portions at a restaurant"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We absolutely loved the food here. There are lots of vegan options, just make sure you ask for the vegetarian menu when you arrive!

The pickled mustard green salad, sweet corn fritters and potato and gourd curry are not to be missed. A great combo together.

Yum!

Portion size is not huge.

Atmosphere is cool, trying to be authentic."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"The chicken matches & mango and the pickled mustard greens salad are very delicious! I liked the corn fritters, the minced meat, and the potato curry. The tendon curry and the aubergine were a bit bland for my taste. All the dishes go well together and it is definitely a memorable meal. Lovely music and a fun atmosphere and the service is very friendly. But make sure you ask for the vegetarian menu because even though we expressed interest in trying different dishes that didn‚Äôt have pork, we weren‚Äôt told that we could have some of the dishes without it (such as the pickled mustard greens) until we‚Äôve ordered most of our food and even then we weren‚Äôt given a vegetarian menu to look at. So I would recommend you ask for both menus before placing your order. All in all, I would highly recommend this place!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We came to Speedboat Bar on a whim quite early‚Äîaround 5 pm‚Äîand managed to get a seat. The decor is styled like a fast-food bar in Bangkok, and while the colourful and slightly tacky-looking menu and design may seem basic at first glance, they are, in fact, well crafted in that style (if you have a design eye!). The menu feels authentic (to a Brit like me who's only visited Bangkok once!) and refreshingly different from what you might expect at typical Thai restaurants in London (don't expect a Green Curry on the menu!). That‚Äôs what makes it special‚Äîeverything feels both interesting and familiar. We ordered a variety of dishes, as you can see, ranging from fried rice to beef noodles and crispy pork. Every dish was fantastic, with a great balance of spice and flavour‚Äîsome of the best Thai food I‚Äôve had in London with the flavour. The prices are expected for the central location, and the portion sizes are good. The beer selection is pretty much all Singha brand, which are typically pretty light later pairs well with the food. Drinks are available by the bottle, half pint, or tower, alongside some interesting cocktails - although they didn't have the Negroni available. Visit Speedboat Bar if you‚Äôre after fantastic food in a fun, unpretentious setting."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Yummy food! But not life changing. More like a 4.5 but Google doesn‚Äôt support that.

The steamed aubergine was actually our favourite. The beef tongue curry was a little chewy, but I enjoyed the tendons! Our fried eggs were cold which was sad. The sweetcorn fritters were good but not life changing. Some were a bit expensive

Really enjoyed the taro ice cream, although the pineapple pie was okay

Overall think I enjoyed plaza khao gheng for food a little more.
Service was really lovely!
Tables were pretty squished"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Finally got to try this place after all the hype and recommendations. I have to say, the food options (way more interesting and exciting than your average high street Thai restaurant or takeaway) were varied and modern and the quality was superb. I'll be coming back with some friends in the near future.

The morning glory was the best I've had outside of Thailand and the black pepper sea bream was original and so tasty. Everything did have a spicy kick to it, but it made it authentic! The restaurant has a cool vibe and feels a bit like being in Thailand with the cutlery they use, the stainless steel tables, the pictures of the Royal Family on the walls etc. I'd say it's definitely a casual atmosphere and more of a cafe vibe than restaurant, which is why it feels authentically Thai.

Service from our main waitress was very good, she was friendly and polite. They also let us add one extra person to the booking on arrival.... which was much appreciated.

My only negative comment is the portion sizes! Some of them are so small we had to order double after tucking into our mains. I guess that is why the quality is so good as they are tight with the dish sizes...

Bill came to ¬£117 including service for 3 adults for lunch, without alcohol or starters. Just loads of mains and sides."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,We were recommended this Thai place during our last visit to London and thought we must try. Note you need to make a reservation well in advance. I made mine 3 weeks in advanced just to be sure. I think the outdoor seating is first come first serve however but that‚Äôs risky in London when it can rain all of a sudden. The staff are very friendly and explained the whole menu to us. I just wish they were a bit more honest on the spiciness of the food. We ordered some of the curries and were told that it was mild. They were very spicy and quite uncomfortable to eat. Other than the spice though they were delicious and tasted very authentic and similar to food I had when visiting Thailand a couple of years ago. I highly recommend to anyone who loved Thai and can handle spicy food. I‚Äôd avoid the alcoholic cocktails as they were quite watered down and not the greatest. Best to stick with a nice Thai beer or water! Enjoy!
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"An absolute surprise to find such amazing tasting Thai food in a ""Bar""

Highly recommend this place for Thai food but he warned the spice levels are high.

The aubergine was delicious and so was the prawn ceviche.

Don't forget to order the corn fritters for starters and the rice noodles with prawn and the beans ü•∞"
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Got a table for lunch on a rainy Sunday afternoon without a reservation- be warned it is a busy popular place and we have failed to eat here before sans reservation.
Great food and atmosphere. Quirky uniforms for the servers. Service is quick, friendly and efficient.
We shared the absolutely delicious chicken matches with green mango kerabu. And will order it again. The portion looks small but it packs a punch and can easily be shared by 2 if you are ordering more food. The crispy egg noodles, gravy, pork , prawns and squid was underwhelming- the gravy was not ‚ÄòThai‚Äô enough- almost western, dare I say and we were probably expecting something tangy and exciting. Still, we asked for and got some birds eye chilli which definitely made an improvement. Crispy pork and black pepper with a rice side lived up to expectations. The food was delicious and different from anything one usually gets in a Thai restaurant. Giving it a 4 * only because the noodles did not live up to our expectations. But will be back to try other things in the menu."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Second visit and reminded us of why we couldn't wait to come back. All of the dishes are so tasty and packed full of flavours.
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Wasn't too bad for a first visit. No frills and you will come out smelling of the kitchen goodness you were steeped in hehe. We were sat downstairs in the main restaurant in a cosy corner. We had a milk tea and a cocktail with the sweetcorn fritters to get going and they were OK. Cocktail felt watered down though - can't remember the name but it had guava in it which is why I chose it. Sweetcorn fritters a touch oily but not off-puttingly so. Mains were the special Maggie mee pot and we also had the whole dry curry sea bream. These were fair. Not crazy delicious, i have to say but filled a gap. The instant noodles dish (i say as an asian who loves instant noodles lol) was big and I struggled to finish it actually possibly due to the tom yum soup being the creamy one rather than the lighter broth one. Taro ice cream was nice as was the pineapple tart it came with.

FYI The bathrooms are upstairs and there are only two unisex to use which you will definitely need to really push the doors hard to check if they are in use otherwise you will be politely waiting for ages lol the restaurant should do something to make it easier or more visible to see whether they are in use or not. It was mentioned our booking was for a birthday, but there was no acknowledgement of this so I wonder what's the point of having this feature in the booking process."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"An overhyped restaurant that is overpriced with average food, average service and average decor. You‚Äôd go once and never return.

The chicken skins were small portion and shockingly cold when they arrived. I asked and they told me, it was cooked previously and served cold. So I sent it back. Cold chicken skin - unbelievable.

The corn fritters were hot and freshly made but bland. Good portion but the chilli sauce was straight from a bottle. Not worth ¬£8.

The glass noodles (vermicelli) were nice but tiny portion with so little chicken. Not worth the ¬£14 price.

Half a pint of Singha was quite pricey.

Toilet was shocking and seat was broken.

Don‚Äôt believe the hype. Avoid"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"First of all, the service is slow. Food is great for most dishes, we recommend crispy pork and the fish fillet.
The mama noodle was a disaster, it‚Äôs something that we can definitely make at home with few simple ingredients, and the dish was 30 üí∑, and it wasn‚Äôt even good lol.

The worst part if the bill, they included donation money which we had no clue about. I found out when looking at the bills and did request to took it off.
Would we go back? No
Do we recommend? No"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"The flavour is fabulous! Not too salty or sweet, it's just right! The fish is perfectly fried and the curry is creamy. My friend like the corn fritters a lot. I like the fish! The rest are nice too. I will definitely be back! Please make a reservation! Always full!

Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Very tasty authentic Thai food! I needed a place for lunch before going to the show Les Miserables and found this Thai place so I walked in with no booking.
I  had some Pad See Ew beef and a whiskey ice for lunch. The fried noodles tasted super good and the beef was very tender! I love my meal but I think it's slightly small in portion for the price.
The staff was friendly!"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Unfortunately I'm updating my review and downgrading it to a 2 out of 5. The Tom Yum that had impressed me so much on my previous visit was disappointing. The balance was not ok and it was extremely sour (of course it needs to be sour but this was too much. It was not pleasant to eat). The egg yolk did not turn the broth into the silky one I remembered. Service was also not great. It took ages to get the order and to get the bill. Such a disappointment. I used to adore this place.

Old review
No doubt that this was the best Thai food I've ever had outside of Thailand. Every single dish was absolutely delicious. They all had different levels of heat but in no case the heat covered any of the other flavours. My mouth and lips were tingling when I left the place. The best dish by miles was the Tom Yum soup. Completely different to any other Tom Yum I've ever had before. The creaminess that the egg yolk added completely changed the broth. It was scrumptious. Can't wait to go back again"
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"We really enjoyed the food. The crispy pork curry was delicious and had just the right amount of heat and the Naem fried rice was one of the best fried rice I‚Äôve ever had - just such great wok flavours. Sadly, the service didn‚Äôt match the food. We started off with a Chinese girl who was very pleasant and friendly but then there seemed to be a change of shift and she disappeared and a couple of young guys started serving our table. The service was very robotic or like a couple of students who had just been told what to do with no attempt to connect with the customer. Or perhaps it‚Äôs the 12.5% service charge and they don‚Äôt care as they know they will get some tips.
They also charged us 50p for some extra fish sauce. I‚Äôd understand if it was a home-made sauce but it comes from a mass-produced bottle and is probably something that most customers don‚Äôt touch and gets thrown away all the time.
Great food but improve the service and this place is a 5 star."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"A really cool themed Thai restaurant!! The inside of the restaurant was decorated in a very interesting way, it gave the place a great atmosphere and a relaxing feeling. The service was good nothing to complain about.
We loved the cool names and dishes on both the drinks and food menu. The only thing I would definitely say to watch out for is the spicy warnings on the menu, they are incredibly hot and not for the faint hearted."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Great food, great drinks and friendly staff. Best Thai food in China Town!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Okay here‚Äôs must order at this place from a Thai food huge fan - Tong yum mama noodles, minced pork/beef rice with a fried egg, stir fried morning glory.

Super nice, the minced meat would be spicy but smells too good, I just couldn‚Äôt resist‚Ä¶"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Sensational. Scrumptious. Surprising. Satisfying. Speedboat.
I‚Äôve wanted to try Speedboat Bar for ages, and it absolutely delivered.

We dropped in after a day of shopping in London‚Äîme, my wife, and our son Thomas‚Äîand luckily managed to get a table without a booking. The staff were friendly and welcoming from the moment we walked in.

We started with corn fritters and crispy pork‚Äîboth full of flavour, crispy, and seriously addictive. But it was the mains that blew us away: naem fried rice, minced beef with holy basil, cellophane noodles with chicken, and crispy pork in black pepper sauce. Every dish was a total knockout. My son looked like he was about to lick the plate clean (and honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed him).

Dessert? Pineapple pie with taro ice cream and mango pudding with red pomelo‚Äîboth were next-level good.

Massive shoutout to Abigail, whose service made the meal even more special. Speedboat Bar was well worth the wait, and we‚Äôll definitely be back‚Äîwith a reservation and an empty stomach."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We went for a birthday celebration and left very satisfied. We were recommended two dishes by a fellow diner and they did not disappoint. The food was incredibly tasty, and the wait staff advised which ones were quite spicy which was a good warning. Every dish we ordered was packed with a flavoursome punch, the cocktails were delicious and the Leo Lager was the perfect drink!
We ordered the sweetcorn fritters and prawn civiche for starters. Both were delicious but the prawns were super spicy, we were advised to remove the fresh chilly on top if we didn't want them to be too hot (I did but my partner consumed them all!)
We also ordered the Morning Glory (incredible flavours) the Mince Beef (packs a punch of spice, delicious) the crispy pork (delicious but could have been crispier) and the wide noodles (my favourite!)
Finished off sharing the pineapple pie which was perfect.
The staff were all lovely and welcoming, and quick the take our order.
Spent ¬£150 for 2 with alcohol which I thought was very reasonable!
Delightful restaurant and will definitely be back!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The food was outstanding. Venison was extra tender and was just melting in mouth - definitely recommend this dish. Cooked to the perfection. Get it together with the broccoli salad which was crunchy and flavourful too. Octopuses weren't my personal choice so I can't speak of its preparation but my partner did enjoy them very much so they must have been delicious too!
To my taste, the deserts, despite served in a unique way, didn't steal the show that evening. We did like them though as they weren't overly sweet and the texture was perfect.
Atmosphere was perfect - quiet and serene - and the waiter who served us was able to help us select dishes and articulated the details of each dish very clearly."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,We enjoyed a set course pre-theatre meal. Our server Lana along with her colleagues were fabulous. Our dinner was wonderful and we highly recommend The Restaurant at St Martins Lane.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic lunch on their new summer menu. I was looked after Monika which I have to say was fantastic host that greeted me with a smile and carried it till the end. And the seabass, omg it was the highlight cooked to perfection!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Lovely experience of dining at the Restaurant at St Martins Lane. The staff was excellent. We chose the pre-theater meal. Food was delicious as well. The whole setting of the restaurant was quite interesting. It's a perfect place to dine before watching any west end shows in my opinion.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"My wife and I celebrated our Valentine's date at this restaurant, and it was an unforgettable dining experience. From the moment we stepped inside, the cozy and welcoming ambiance enveloped us, setting the stage for a truly romantic evening.

The menu was nothing short of impressive, offering a delightful variety of dishes that seemed to cater to our every craving. Each dish we ordered was a masterpiece, showcasing a brilliant combination of ingredients that danced together perfectly on the palate. The flavors were rich, sophisticated, and beautifully balanced, reflecting the high level of culinary expertise behind their creation.

Not to be overlooked, the drinks selection was extensive, featuring everything from classic cocktails to non alcoholic beverages, ensuring the perfect pairing for every course of our meal. The attentive staff recommended excellent choices that complemented our meals exquisitely.

In every aspect, this place delivered a luxurious dining experience that made our Valentine's celebration truly special. The care and detail put into every aspect of our visit were evident, making it a place we would highly recommend to anyone looking to create memorable moments over exceptional food and drink."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Went for a bottomless brunch. Food was off-the-scale delicious! Drink chosen to be bottomless was fab, and not watered down. Great brunch location."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"I ordered the theatre menu.
The food was good and everything was well made, the produce was fresh and high quality. But it lacked layers in texture and flavor. So even though everything was well prepared it still tasted a bit flat.
But all in all I had a good dining experience and the staff was very friendly, especially Juliana and Yvette."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"This was a surprising find, and a perfect pre-theater dinner spot. Although restaurants in a hotel are not always great, my friend and I really enjoyed their two-course dinner before running off to the theater. The pre-theater menu lasts till 7pm and it wasn‚Äôt crowded on a week night. Octopus salad and cod fish were cooked to perfection. Sweet potato fries were delish! Service from the rest of the staff was spotty but our server who spoke Spanish was very good and he was funny."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"From the moment we arrived, the service was absolutely impeccable. Every detail was looked after with care, professionalism, and genuine warmth. The atmosphere was lively yet relaxed, making it the perfect setting for a wonderful meal.

A special mention must go to Skender, who truly went above and beyond to make our experience exceptional. Skender was attentive without being intrusive, incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, and had a natural friendliness that made us feel completely at home. He made excellent recommendations and made sure we were looked after at every step.

It‚Äôs rare to find service that feels both five-star and genuinely heartfelt ‚Äî Skender delivered exactly that. He is a true credit to the team at The Restaurant.

Thank you for an outstanding experience ‚Äî we will definitely be back"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Our experience at St Matins Lane restaurant was fabulous. Monika was especially cheerful and helpful. We had the breakfast buffet attached to our room‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and I would have to say was the best breakfast buffet I have ever had at any hotel anywhere. Food was fresh and whole, not the cheap premix foods that are so often seen."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Amazing evening , surprise ‚Ä¶ our waiter was so attentive and kind . The food was beuon expectations. The dishes were amazingly delicious and presented like piece of art . This place is simply fabulous. The desserts were stunning"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Had a lovely evening. Was served by Adar and he was so friendly, and helpful. He gave some good recommendations. Thoroughly enjoyed our food. A lovely experience and so close to the theatre district."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Delayed post‚Ä¶

Haven‚Äôt been here in years !! Was soooooo good!! Pleasantly surprised actually!! Party of 7! Food was delicious and very tasty!!! Get ALL the desserts! Service was on point! Come here for conversations and catch ups, as you will need to bring the ‚ÄòAtmosphere‚Äô

Or head to the bar after too!
Definitely recommend! coming back again soon! Thank you!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,"It was our last night in London and we found this place with high ratings on Google. We got a main dish of ox cheek waygu and it was okay, not juicy, had a bone marrow sauce and was topped with more beef? The potatoes had no flavor. The sauce was gross but thought maybe it‚Äôs an acquired taste. We decided to try two desserts figuring no dessert is bad. Boy were we wrong. Both deserts the Black Forest and blackberry tart were absolutely disgusting. I‚Äôm not sure if something in it was off but the Black Forest was a strange consistency with no flavor and the blueberry tart had no hint of blueberry at all and instead tasted salty and nearly inedible. My husband who is too polite to say anything ate it all. We left and did not say anything, but it was the worst meal we have had in our life and came in at a super high price. I would avoid this restaurant at all costs. Wish we said something and saved $50 on the desserts."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Lovely place with a simple fixed price pre-theater menu and small Michelin star portions. Service was very well-coordinated and friendly. The dining room was too dimly lit and unfortunately quite empty at 6pm on Easter Sunday. I hope they are more busy and successful on other days. Overall a good balance of quality and price but the a la carte menu is probably too expensive for most
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,3.0,"The restaurant is at the ground floor of the hotel‚Äôs lobby. Nice interior and ambience. Staffs are friendly and service was fantastic.

Ordered the pre-theatre menu via Timeout. We paid ¬£30pp for 3 courses including a glass of house wine.

Had the octopus for starters, pan seared cod for mains and pear tart for dessert. Pear tart was quite good, the rest were ok.

Great place to catch up with friends in a less noisy setting. We also didn‚Äôt feel rushed to leave the restaurant."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Food was decent but a little pricey even if it was very nicely plated and served. Staff were attentive and helpful and overall it was a good experience although there was a little confusion over my OpenTable booking.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"There was a big group of us who hadn't seen each other in a very long time, so we were quite slow with ordering, but the attitude we received from the waitress and other staff was unnecessarily brusque.

We didn't let this marr the evening and when the food came out it was surprisingly good. I hadn't actually looked at any reviews, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was a really nice contrast to the service.

Between all of us, it felt like we ordered the entire menu, and everything we ordered everyone seemed to enjoy.

Just a shame that at every turn, the staff made us feel like we were putting them out."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Had a lovely meal in the restaurant at St Martins Lane. Food was fabulous and there was an interesting menu of cocktails, which we enjoyed with great quality olives.

The staff were friendly and attentive and keen to give good service and a great experience.

Note to management: please give James and Juliana a decent corkscrew! They were fantastic but hampered in their efforts to deliver a fine bottle of St Emillion because a poor quality corkscrew ruined the cork!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Wonderful restaurant. Highly recommended. Great pre theatre menu. Interesting food and excellent food.

I had the carpaccio and it was so delicious I asked the waitress to explain the ingredients. I then had the trout with delicious courgette with honey glazed carrots, which was also Delicious.

The sommelier was also very helpful. The proseco and carafe of pinot grigio went well. And it was kept cold which was very appropriate for a warm summer's eyening.

Well decorated. Nice ambience.

We shall return!

A great restaurant."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Had a nice meal in the outdoor terrace area. Lovely atmosphere and didn‚Äôt feel over crowded. I enjoyed my salad. Lovely presentation! There was a great wide range of fresh ingredients although I personally found the dressing was quite sweet which overpowered in places. The service was above and beyond! Extremely friendly and attentive.

We attended for a pre-theatre dinner.
A wonderful experience with fantastic service. Some interesting/abstract dishes on the menu that were fun to try.
The service was fantastic and the setting was romantic.
The camembert was incredible and the watermelon soup, although an obscure dish, was fantastic!
For mains we had sole & ribeye which were well presented and perfectly cooked.
Would happily recommend this to friends and will certainly be back."

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Great service from the start, was seated and seen to promptly
ordered a prawn starter which we honestly did not enjoy as much but I believe that was due to our palette and not the dish however the staff still noticed this even though we had not mentioned this to them and comped the dish from our final bill which we found very kind
steak was great and even managed to convert my partner to eating medium rare instead of well done after enough convincing from me
the presentation of all courses was great as well which is always important
as id mentioned it was a birthday occasion on our open table reservation the chef was kind enough to send out beautiful desserts for us making the day more special and after this the staff even invited us to visit ‚ÄúBlind Spot‚Äù for cocktails after our meal, where the atmosphere and drinks were amazing
here i was served a great old fashioned even though i asked for this specially as it was not on the menu, i would also reccomend the sydney and the copenhagen
overall great products with even better service thank you :)"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"I had a wonderful experience at Ellamia Caffe!

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,I sat in outside terrace and ordered a very tasteless glass of rose which took ten minutes as the unfriendly waitress who proceeded ti bring the 2 tables after Mr there drinks before mine. I also had asked for pink prosecco  the drink was ¬£17.90 not worth a fraction  beautiful hotel but this experience brought it down in my estimation
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Absolutely amazing experience, the staff was very friendly! I can understand it‚Äôs a high end restaurant but ‚Äúlet us breathe‚Äù don‚Äôt come to the table every couple of minutes to check on the food or pour the water which is a very kind gesture but no need at all!
This one staff member was absolutely amazing and super friendly which i loved and wished i got his name!"

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Very good service from the whole team especially Adan. They brought a surprise bday cake as it was my friend bday! Very attentive service throughout.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,2.0,"Impossibly slow service. The restaurant was mostly empty, plenty of disorganised waiters, each time a different person coming to our table and forgetting our request.

The food - lamb ribs were very good but served lukewarm, duck rillettes was bad, ratatouille was nice.

Atmosphere- soulless, nothing special, not like the photos at all."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Enjoyed the festive afternoon tea.

Food was great, especially the savoury selection. This is one of my favourite afternoon teas in London.

Staff are fabulous, in particular Monika was friendly and professional. She Made everyone feel very welcome."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The best meal I‚Äôve had in ages! Every dish was incredible, full of flavour and brilliant service. Our server Manuel was very attentive, thank you."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Lovely dining room, and servers were courteous and attentive. There were a couple of breakfast options for those who require gluten-free meals, but not sure if it would be celiac safe. Was a bit disappointed that the acai bowl is actually just yogurt with acai powder, but it was still very tasty. Full English was alright, nothing special. Unfortunately, the cappuccino ordered was only tepid in temperature, but when brought to the server's attention it was quickly remade. Overall, the experience was OK, but there are better options in the area for breakfast."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Restaurant at hotel! Breakfast is good and basic!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Wonderful tea service, including a vegan option.  The art in the room also has great character.  Our server Monika was also great and provided nice explanations of each tea service item.  Definitely a great experience!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Absolutely wonderful meal at this hotel restaurant. Very serious chef. Salade Nicoise and chicken were both terrific. Extremely good value for London. Their Rioja by the glass is also great value. Highly recommended.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"A lovely time with the family for my partner's birthday lunch. Bottomless brunch. Lobster Benedict was amazing.
Our lovely waiter Anastasiia was attentive at every step, Vivien the Manager visited our table to welcome us. Marek, the Bartender made an excellent birthday cocktail for my partner. Tobacco dock was delicious!

Thank you and will visit again."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Great service from our server Lana and amazing pre theatre menu. Food is absolutely amazing! Would definitely back !

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Had the festive afternoon tea with friends, and I could not fault a thing. Delicious food, welcoming staff, and lovely atmosphere. I will definitely go back again next time I'm in London."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Stopped for drinks after show.
Had great service and loved the relaxing atmosphere and beautiful setting."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"We were looking for somewhere to eat before a theatre show and found this. The food was excellent and Monika, our waitress, look after us extremely well. Highly recommended."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"We had a lovely dinner before our show. Our waiter, Manuel, made sure that the food came out in time, and helped us celebrate our anniversary."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Manuel was lovely and attentive, the vibe was quiet and pleasant, food presentation and taste were great although the portions were a bit small.

Chicken was sous-vide, so please consider if you don't like your food being cooked in a plastic bag.
Good vegetarian suggestions on the menu and excellent attention to food allergies from the waiter.

Charging 13.5% service charge and then asking the guest to state an additional sum for the tip and to write the new total has put us in an uncomfortable situation but overall a pleasant experience."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,The food was extra fresh and so many offerings at the breakfast buffet! Monika was especially pleasant and helpful!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"recently visited this beautiful place and it was nothing short of a delightful experience. From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome ‚Äì warm smiles, genuine hospitality, and attentiveness that felt personal without being overwhelming.

The food? Simply amazing. Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and clearly crafted with care.

What made the evening even better was the ambiance ‚Äì cozy and inviting, making it the perfect spot for both intimate dinners and gatherings with friends. Special shoutout to Vanessa, who went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,"We turned up as per our booking on Christmas Day and the restaurant informed us they are not doing  a la carte menu but during booking their website allowed us to book for meal without Christmas menu (¬£150 pp)

So misleading and completely ruined our Christmas."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Great restaurant! We managed to spend an unforgettable evening here with a boyfriend. It was a wonderful evening and not least thanks to the restaurant!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,I came to the brunch at St martins lane and the food was amazing! Besides the service from Frayer and Jo√£o was brilliant and very warm.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Lovely start to the day here every morning, and the hospitality of all staff, particularly Kohinoor was exceptional. Thank you for taking care of my mates and I! Can‚Äôt wait to return"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"We just had a fabulous afternoon tea with my 10-years old daughter in The Den.  All the food were perfectly presented in a stylish bird-themed china and the cake stand. The best bit was the taste - full of flavours and not-too-sweet.

It was clearly the best afternoon tea we have ever had (we even tried one at The Shard - was too sweet and too crowded ).

Juliana was so friendly and helpful with accommodating our dietary requestüíï

We will surely come back....for more!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,2.0,"We ordered an omelette and acai bowl. The acai bowl was not an acai bowl. It actually contained no acai at all and was just a yogurt base. When we asked our waitress about it she confirmed there was no acai in it at all and that it was just a yogurt bowl with fruit. It would have been nice if she would have flagged that the name was incorrect on the menu as we assumed the acai was mixed with the yogurt based off the name and description. It was good, but very disappointing at the same time as it was not what I ordered. I would have definitely ordered something else if I would have been aware. The omelette was very good with a lot of spinach which was a nice change up from other places that skimp on it."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Food was fantastic and the service was top tier! Juliana, our server, was simply amazing!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Great food, surprisingly creative and delicious  ‚ÄúBlack Forest‚Äù dessert , and a wonderful server in Aarati who was delightful."

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,I dropped in after the theatre for dessert. Manuel assisted in choosing a delicious pan Scott‚Äôs and a cheese plate. Superb service.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The afternoon tea at The Den was amazing, the taste and look of everything was amazing. We went with a 8 mo baby and the seating disposition left enough space for him not to be overwhelmed, besides that the staff was super friendly. Kahinoor served us the whole time and made us feel very comfortable and accommodated.
My mum, who is very picky about food, and my husband who is picky about the amount of food üòÇ  both left very happy after it.
The next table had a dog so it seems it is also pet friendly.
Finally, I can't help mentioning the decoration of the room that was funny and interesting, we had a nice moment checking the paintings."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"I‚Äôm staying at St Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel and had breakfast at the restaurant this morning. The continental buffet was solid‚Äîfresh fruit, yogurt, granola, and a decent pain au chocolat‚Äîbut the Shakshuka was the real standout. Frayer was attentive without being overbearing, making the experience seamless. The seating was surprisingly comfortable, and the atmosphere felt relaxed. I‚Äôm looking forward to breakfast there again."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"This place was really nice! Service was really good, they accomodated us as a walk-in, and we were treated really well. The atmosphere was super chill."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,"Look, we came here for the great reviews but we noticed a huge lack of execution. The service was fine but our cut of meat was not great and the dessert was off putting, there are better places to eat in the city, I would not recommend."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Great food. Great ambiance and top service firm Nuna!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Excellent restaurant, we got there by accident, but were absolutely satisfied with the quality of service and taste!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Our server, Manuel, was very friendly and helpful. The food was excellent. Our family had a wonderful time here celebrating me and my husband‚Äôs birthdays."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Atmospheric, cozy place, polite and smiling staff, tasty and interesting dishes. We went with a large group of colleagues."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Amazing food and service. Staff Manuel is friendly and surprised us with slice of cake for both of our birthdays. Definitely coming back again. Restaurant is just 6 minutes walk from the palace theatre. Had their 2 course pre-theatre menu
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"It was a very nice meal, the food was good and the waiter Adam was really sympatic."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Very well presented food, not cheap but everything was done very well.  Tuesday night was very quiet but that suited us wanting to catch up."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"My girlfriend and I attended the Den for Afternoon Tea. The food was delicious and selection of tea was great. Additionally, our waitress Aarati was very attentive and overall excellent. I would highly recommend this experience."

A bit pricey but totally deserving"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Came here for a meeting. The food was honestly exceptional was really surprised on how good everything was. Our starter with the beef pot, Yorkshire‚Äôs and gravy was absolutely fantastic, couldn‚Äôt recommend more. The steak were fairly tough but had incredible flavour was very impressed. Lovely atmosphere aswell, a must visit."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"We had the lunch set menu which is an amazing value. Yorkshire pudding was perfect. We had it with bone marrow with caramelised onions (not included in the set menu). Very unique and rich in flavour! No photo for the steak cos I just dove in. Steak was tender, juicy, rich in flavour, just perfect. You cannot find better value than this I guess!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"We visited Hawksmoor on Air Street yesterday for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday dinner, after my boss, who is a regular, highly recommended it. The restaurant is set in a beautiful art deco style with dimmed lighting. The food was delicious, and the service was polite.

From the moment we were seated, however, the table next to us, two women in their late 40s, made us feel uncomfortable by staring at us and pulling faces, as if questioning why we were there. Immediately, they began coughing repeatedly in our direction. There was empty space on their other side, yet the coughing still came our way. It happened so often that it was hard to ignore, and while I can understand it might be difficult for staff to notice something like this if they‚Äôre not standing nearby, it did have a big impact on our evening. My boyfriend and I didn‚Äôt discuss it at the time because they were right beside us, but afterwards we found we both experienced it the same way.

We waited about 50 minutes for our food, which felt long for this type of restaurant. In the end, we were almost grateful for the delay, at least the coughing didn‚Äôt happen while our food was on the table.

Had it not been for this neighbouring table, we would have had an amazing evening. I hope staff can be aware of similar situations in future to help keep all guests comfortable."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Honestly one of the best meals I‚Äôve had. Such good food, so tasty and so much satisfaction in every bite. The service was really great and the atmosphere was on point too and this was a Wednesday lunchtime. Cocktails and wine also delicious. Cheers!

Never been to a Hawksmoor before but will be a regular from now on."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Fabulous as always.
Special mention to our waiter Lucas - the service was perfect. He was helpful charming and great personality.
Big mention to Jam at reception we were a couple of minutes late and she checked in with us to make sure everything was ok.

Great food as always"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Came here for an early weekday dinner.
Ordered the Chateaubriand steak - was amazing and cooked as requested.
Tried the bone marrow sauce which was good, but nothing can beats the classic peppercorn sauce.
Waitress was amazing and was able to accommodate the steak portions with our table size and also the price.
However.. after checking the receipt, noticed they had charged full price on the cocktail drinks when they should‚Äôve been the ‚Äòhappy hour‚Äô prices.

EDIT: they've suggested for me to reach out to them following their billing mistake, however there isn't many way to contact them directly other than emailing through their website. I've tried this way but still not heard anything."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Love this place!  The food is delicious and a great value too. The wait staffs is attentive and friendly. we ordered from the pre-theater menu and the price you just can‚Äôt beat it.  The charcoal chicken Anna Mari is yummy, the Roast Hake  is light and moist.  The 25 day rump steak was a little dry, need the pepper gravy to make it tasty. What I love the most is the potted beef and bacon starter, dipping it in the gravy is so delicious.  A must try restaurant if you are in London and watching a show."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"This was a great steak house. Nice atmosphere. Great and friendly service.
We had for starters, bone marrow and onion really good the onion makes it and the belly ribs which was fine and tasted good but nothing to write home about. I would only have the bone marrow and onion next time and a bigger stake.
Rib eye 650g medium, really good and was perfectly cooked. anchovies hollandaise sauce is a must have. chips on the side was great.
Sticky toffee pudding for desert...yeah that is elite level desert.
Bryce provided amazing service and made the meal more special.
Recommended."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"What a fantastic meal! Started with bone marrow & onions, old spot belly ribs and langoustine scampi - all were delicious. Just look at that rib eye, beautiful cut and cooked for perfection! Beef dripping chips and macaroni cheese went great as sides. Will need to come back for their Sunday roast"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Had the BEST experience at Hawksmoor. Our waiter, Cosmin was exceptional. He was was attentive to my sister and I

He made me a surprise cocktail which was incredible - highly recommend

Sunday roast was amazing"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"I had the pleasure of dining at Hawksmoor Air Street last night, and I can confidently say that it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. From the moment we arrived, the service was warm, attentive, and incredibly professional. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything was perfect, striking the ideal balance between being welcoming and giving us the space to enjoy our evening.

The food was exceptional. The medium rare Chateaubriand was cooked to absolute perfection‚Äîtender, rich in flavour, and seared beautifully on the outside. Every bite melted in the mouth, reaffirming why Hawksmoor is regarded as one of the best steakhouses in London. The accompanying sides were just as impressive‚Äîfrom the indulgent potato mash to the creamed spinach and the perfectly seasoned bone marrow gravy, each dish complemented the steak flawlessly.

The drinks selection was equally fantastic. The wine pairing was spot on, enhancing the flavours of the meal, and the cocktails were expertly crafted, balancing bold flavours with just the right amount of finesse. The bartenders truly know their craft.

What really stood out, beyond the quality of the food and drink, was the impeccable service. Every staff member we encountered was friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely invested in making our experience a memorable one. They took the time to ensure that everything was to our liking and were more than happy to accommodate a request for a slightly more secluded table, making the evening even more enjoyable.

This visit was a special occasion, and I sincerely appreciate the effort made by the team to ensure it was an unforgettable evening. I cannot recommend Hawksmoor Air Street highly enough. If you're looking for a top-tier steakhouse in London with impeccable service, incredible food, and a refined yet relaxed atmosphere, this is the place to go.

A huge thank you to Alicia and the entire team‚ÄîI will most certainly be returning!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Good restaurant with great service, especially for steaks. The staff were attentive and the space is big and comfortable. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area and craving a good steak."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"My favourite steak restaurant in London! My favourite cut is the fillet, the creamed spinach is to die for!!! For every celebration we find an excuse to visit‚≠êÔ∏è. Also, make sure you leave room for dessert for their fantastic sticky toffee pudding"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"This was our second time round at Hawksmoor and they delivered. Our first experience was subpar but the service throughout our second experience was exemplary. A shoutout to Thiago from Hawksmoor Edinburgh for being so understanding.

The drinks are lovely, I‚Äôd recommend the Lychee martini if you‚Äôre after something sweet.
The food was exactly as you would expect, the meat was cooked perfectly and sides were impeccable. I would recommend the mac and cheese and the chips. The bone marrow was not a hit, would have liked it to be a bit more flavourful.
The highlight definitely has the be the sticky toffee pudding.
Alicia and the team were so knowledgeable and looked after us perfectly and we would definitely be back :)"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and was fantastic. It reminded me of a NY style steak restaurant. The food was excellent! As we were leaving, one of the managers engaged in conversation with us and ended up asking if we were celebrating anything. When we told him the trip was a ‚ÄòBirthday‚Äô trip, he ended up bringing us all chocolate truffles with ‚ÄòHappy Birthday‚Äô written on the plate. He really went out of his way to make our experience special."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Really lovely. Came for Lunch on a Saturday and it was really relaxed and empty. Service are very friendly and attentive.

We ordered a couple glasses of very nice wine, the Caesar Salad, 400g Sirloin, Bone Marrow add on, and sides of Garlic Mushrooms, Macaroni Cheese and the Bitter Leaf salad.

We were too full for dessert, but this was the perfect amount of food for 2. Would look forward to coming back to try a Sunday Roast!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Hawksmoor serves good steak üçΩÔ∏è. This particular branch is spacious, and very central. You walk in and go up the lift (or stairs, if you're into that) to the dining area.

There are quite a few steak options to choose from, as well as a variety of sides ü§§. The bone marrow side is particularly nice! Salad portion is pretty small. Steak is lovely.

They also have a bunch of cocktail selections üç∏. I think they go down quite nice with the steak. A bit of deviation from the standard red wine doesn't hurt.

It's not excruciatingly expensive, but not cheap either. You get what you pay for.

You can takeaway, if circumstances force you to, but only after you have ""dined"" your meal a bit i.e. taken at least one bite out of your food.

Service is great, though when it's busy it can be hard to get attention.

Overall, it's very nice for special occasions, family dine-out, or date night! Just check the menu beforehand and ensure it's within budget. ‚ú®"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"One of the best dining experiences I had in London!!
We arrived a group of 8 people and everyone was very satisfied with the food and the service. We were served by lovely Alexandra who did above and beyond for one of us who was not happy with her steak, and tried her best so everyone will be pleased.
The meat was delicious and the desserts were amazing.
Had a great time, would love to come back again next time I visit London."
Hawksmoor Air Street,3.0,"I recently dined at Hawksmoor Air Street and had a generally enjoyable experience. The service throughout the evening was attentive, friendly, and professional, and the atmosphere had the classic, polished feel that Hawksmoor is known for.

The food was well-executed‚Äîsteaks cooked to perfection, rich in flavor, and clearly high quality. While the sides were delicious, the portions were on the smaller side, especially considering the price point.

Unfortunately, the evening took a disappointing turn toward the end of our meal when we saw a few mice run across the floor of the dining area. We immediately informed the front-of-house staff and asked to speak to a manager. We were told they would pass along the information, but we were not given any follow-up or assurance that the issue was being addressed.

It‚Äôs a shame, as the overall experience up to that point had been quite positive. I truly hope management takes this matter seriously, as it's not something you'd expect to encounter at a restaurant of this caliber. With its strong reputation and excellent food, Hawksmoor has the foundation to provide an exceptional dining experience‚Äîso long as issues like this are promptly and transparently resolved."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"A place for relaxing and gathering with a good atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Always have a smile. The pudding was fantastic,I finished in no time. Very thoughtful after I mentioned it was my son's 19th birthday ,they prepared a small message for him on his pudding dish. I was very touched ( even my son was embarrassed).
However,the steak was a bit chewy despite the rump steak.
Having said that the restaurant is worthy to visit and enjoy to have a good time."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"We really enjoyed our experience dining here, it‚Äôs a fun location and the food was delicious. My only complaint is that they really pack the tables in there to fit as many people as possible and it felt a bit crowded and got pretty loud. I would definitely recommend the potted beef and bacon starter, it was amazing."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Visiting London from the US and wanted to try a chophouse here in the UK. Hawksmoor has charming art deco decor, my wife loved it. But more importantly, the serve reserved, well prepared steaks. There was nothing over the top about the presentation, but the steaks are very nice cuts of meat. We tried several sides, the garlic mushrooms and mac-n-cheese were particularly delicious. Our server was from Poland, sorry, forgot her name. However, she made thoughtful suggestions and really took good care of us. Definitely recommend for a nicer evening."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"We visited for a Sunday roast and had such a wonderful experience! Our server, Rhys, was extremely helpful, professional, and polite throughout ‚Äì nothing was too much trouble, and he really made us feel well looked after. The manager, Alicia, was equally attentive and went above and beyond by giving us thoughtful recommendations for things to do after our meal, which we really appreciated. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was welcoming, and the service was exceptional. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great dining experience"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Had my Birthday Lunch at Hawksmoor Air Street on the 21st of December.
Even though my group was a bit late staff were absolutely amazing and accommodating.
I shared 700gr of Chateaubriand, Mac & Cheese and 2 fries portions with 2 friends and it was the perfect amount. The best meal I had all year for sure. The meat was cooked to perfection, so tender.
Then I shared a sticky toffee pudding with a friend and again, amazing. Glad I shared though cause it is sweet.
We initially had the table only until 2pm but we ended up staying longer to open gifts and talk. We were not rushed out or anything.

Overall amazing experience and will return for sure."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"I had the most amazing 50th birthday meal with my brother on the may bank holiday weekend. It was wonderful , produce was clearly excellent and everything i tried tasted sensational"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"After a long day of walking, we were starving and went to this beautiful restaurant. We had the Sunday Roast and ordered sides as the kids weren‚Äôt too hungry.
Sunday Roast - the potatoes were amazing and the steak was good. The vegetables tasted super delicious and my toddler kept eating the carrots.

Sides
We had mac and cheese- it tasted expensive and did not taste like the unhealthy and cheap mac and cheese

Atmosphere
The atmosphere was amazing. Fully packed but we were very happy.

Service
Was on point. Even though the place was packed we had a designated server who served us the entire time here and it was very pleasant."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Easter Sunday meal. Food was delicious. The wine was good too. Highly recommend but a bit pricey.
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"I went here last night with my friends for a 21st. There was 7 of us and we had a really nice table, and the service was really good considering how busy it was. One issue was we asked for one of the cheaper bottles of wine, and they gave us a different, more expensive one. The wine was still really nice though. For starter I had the hawksmoor smoked salmon which was so tender and with the bread was great. I had the pleasure of trying the bone marrow too which, for the price, id definitely recommend it was so good. For main I had ribeye steak, peppercorn sauce, and me and my friend shared the beef dripping chips and creamed spinach. One thing I‚Äôd say is the steak came out ever so slightly more rare than medium rare but it didn‚Äôt bother me. The chips were really nice and crisp but you don‚Äôt get many so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend sharing. The creamed spinach was also very nice to compliment the steak. I got to try some mac and cheese on its own which was very good too id recommend that, just not sure how it would‚Äôve complimented the steak"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Good food and good service. Tried their signature Sunday roast and a fish main dish. Both dishes were very well executed. A bit pricey but worth going to for a special occasion. The service was impeccable
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"After seeing all the YouTube videos about Hawksmoor, expectations were sky-high. It was good but not exceptional. The staff doesn't wear uniforms but private clothes, which is unusual for a restaurant. The staff is running back and forth and is quick to refill your water, and for this, you pay an ""optional"" 12,5% service fee. I don't feel it is optional, and I prefer the system where you can enter tips on the card terminal. We went for the Express menu, which had three starters, main courses, and desserts. You can choose two dishes for ¬£29 or three for ¬£33, which is quite attractive. We decided on the potted meat and bacon starter, which was both delicious and a rather big serving. The rump steak was tasty but a bit tough, and it didn't come with any sauce (you can order sauce separately). The watercress salad was fresh, though. We decided on different desserts, but the passionfruit Pavlova was refreshing. The restaurant is boisterous, and this is not where to have an important conversation."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"One of the best Sunday Roast and toffee pudding Ive had. The toffee pudding  set the standard very high. Im not into sweets at all but I was able to finish the dessert.

Service was great, attentive, timely and not too pushy. The place was very busy but the food arrived warm and the staff were very friendly and kind.

Definitely family friendly and organized.
Will definitely come back."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Delicious food in a charged environment. I love coming here. It's got a great vibe - full of energy. But noisy and you have to speak up to be heard but aside from that the food is great and service is good too. Come here for a fun night out with friends rather than a serious business meeting.
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,Great food and good service. Pre theatre menu very good and well priced.
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"As soon as we entered we were looked after. This was our special Anniversary dinner and it did not disappoint! My partner had to convince me to come here in the first place as he wanted the steak. I hummed and ahhed about it for a few weeks before giving into him and I am so glad I did! We had some cocktails to start, after drinking all afternoon I needed something to eat fast. So we ordered some bread and butter for the table, and the butter was the best I have tasted in a while! We then ordered the steak, and the charcoal chicken ana Mari and we were both in heaven! The chicken was beautifully cooked and had a lot of flavour. We then ordered dessert, which we ordered a sundae, not knowing if the sticky toffee had dates in as my partner cant stand the texture. We were given a sticky toffee pudding and ice cream on the side, which was comped immediately even though we were more than happy to pay for it. I have never been more pleased for a wrong order! The sticky toffee pudding was heavenly, and perfectly matched with the ice cream. We were so happy we got that instead of the sundae at we got the delicious hot sauce that came with it. The staff were so attentive and couldn't do enough for us. If we are ever near a Hawksmoor again we will make sure we go in for dinner!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Been twice in one month and both times food was great. Lovely filet beef with fries and greens. And if you have any room left, I‚Äôd definitely recommend trying the sticky toffee pudding!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Made an unplanned stop here for dinner and had no issues getting a table but must have timed it just right as the restaurant soon filled up. We started with cocktails, I would highly recommend the full fat old fashioned. For dinner we shared a porterhouse steak and a couple of sides which was more than enough for the two of us, the server advised us on the size of the steak to ensure it was adequate. The steak was exceptional and the bone marrow gravy was delicious. There were plenty of wines to choose from and staff were very attentive topping up our glasses. The restaurant itself is nice and has an art deco feel about it, the entrance is grand and there are arch windows throughout. A visit here is expensive but worth it, all food and drink was of a high quality and the service was excellent. I would highly recommend a visit!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Dining here was a lovely experience, the staff were friendly and attentive. The food was great and everyone in my group enjoyed their meal."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Definitely splashed out and Hawksmoor definitely delivered.

Everything chosen was of exceptional quality. It was a very busy lunch service but everything delivered promptly, sexy looking and incredibly tasty.

Don't have anything to add except - go here at least once when you're in London!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,3.0,"If you‚Äôre a tourist and don‚Äôt know the nuances of a good Sunday roast, then this is an acceptable place. If you‚Äôre a Sunday R connoisseur, then you‚Äôll see through it quite quickly. Staff are great but the roast is max 3/5."
Hawksmoor Air Street,1.0,"Service was exceptionally terrible and totally ruined our lunch. The lady at the reception on 1/F who led us to our table was very rude. The restaurant was less than half full. There were 4 of us all with a few bags after shopping. We asked for a slightly bigger table next to ours but she pulled a long face throughout and rejected us outright as it was ‚Äòunavailable‚Äô (which of course had been vacant throughout our lunch). We then asked another waitress, who also pulled a long face, for an extra chair for our bags, and she questioned why we did not ask for the bigger table next to us. She also told us we could have gone back to the G/F ourselves and drop off our bags at the cloakroom. The 2 other younger waitresses were friendly though and we were happy with the food. But the overall experience was very disappointing and definitely not what I expected from Hawksmoor. DO NOT RECOMMEND. There are many better choices at this price range.
This is by far one of my worst dining experience in London."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Sat at the bar tonight and was looked after by Eldar. Incredibly knowledgeable on the drinks, attentive without being overbearing - couldn‚Äôt have asked for better service. The drinks were absolutely incredible, but I‚Äôd come back just for him. Best experience I‚Äôve had in London, can‚Äôt recommend this place highly enough!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"This is my fourth time here. I never disappoint. Had my friend Birthday Lunch at Hawksmoor Air Street on the 6 January. We got a nice table. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Always have a smile. The steak was delicious. We were pleasantly surprised by the candle and 'happy birthday' written on the plate!
Definitely coming back again ü•∞üòä"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"EXCEPTIONAL SUNDAY ROAST

If you‚Äôre in London, do not sleep on this outstanding steak house.

We went for Sunday roast, and it was out of this world! Meat was juicy and tender, and all the sides were top - amazing gravy as well.

Service was top notch, in particular our server from Hungary was excellent!

Also, do not sleep in the sticky toffee pudding - amazing!

Will definitely be back to try their other cuts!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Everything is always so consistent and delicious, which is why we often come to celebrate special occasions.

We dined on 20/08/2025 @ 19:45. Please pass on our thanks to the amazing staff in particular:
- The waiter in the white shirt (vague, I know) he was serving us cocktails in the lounge area.
- The guy at the desk on the 1st floor who took us to our table (checked or striped shirt) he was just incredibly gracious and courteous.
- Our waiter (black polo top) who was incredibly patient, kind, knowledgeable and just looked after us really well all night.
- Finally, of course the kitchen team who consistently put out delicious food.

Thank you! üëèüèº"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Absolutely amazing experience! The steak was cooked to perfection‚Äîtender, juicy, and full of flavor. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, perfect for a relaxed dinner. Special shout-out to our waitress, Zainab, who truly made the evening exceptional. She was not only professional and attentive but also incredibly friendly, adding a personal touch that made us feel genuinely welcomed. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Great Atmosphere. Friendly and professional staff and welcome. We ordered Sunday Roast, which was a superb and  lovely meal... must do medium pink for the roast beef. I recommend and would definitely return. Thank you."
Hawksmoor Air Street,1.0,"Very poor experience all round. We were a group of five on a Saturday lunchtime.The food was brought to the table barely warm. My fish was not cooked. All commented that their dishes were tasteless. Service was unsmiling, grudging and monosyllabic. We have eaten at Hawksmoor in Shoreditch and Guildhall many times. The contrast with the food and service in Air Street could not be greater."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Absolutely gorgeous! Fantastic juicy meats and brilliant place! Recommend for family and friends.
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Came specially on a Saturday for their full English breakfast, and it did not disappoint! Every component was delicious and well executed. We ordered the portion for 1 and added a salad, which was enough for 2 to share. The 2 pax portion has a bacon chop instead of a bacon. One of the best full English breakfasts I‚Äôve had"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"We dropped in for drinks mid-week between lunch and dinner.  Despite visiting during a transition time, they took good care of us.  We tried a variety of cocktails and they were all very good.  The service staff was very helpful and accommodating.  The bar are is comfortable and well appointed.  We have eaten here in the past and it was very good.  Returning to the Hawksmoor for a cocktail is on our list of London favorites.  We look forward to our next visit."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"We shared a big steak porterhouse which was lovely. Had creamed spinach, fries, mac and cheese as sides. Had the most amazing sticky toffee pudding ever for desert.
Also had some ribs and steak pie thingy. All super.
Would definitely visit again on our next visit to London.
Prices were reasonable for this food I thought."
Hawksmoor Air Street,1.0,"Was attracted by the fantastic review... Decided to enjoy the dinner BUT, it's a great disappoint to be honest.

Service: the service staff was very impatient to begin with.

Food: was the most disappointed. Ordered a medium rare rib eye but was served Welldone with a little pink in the middle only. Yet the manager still told us that its medium rare. Oh come on!  But but but, the bone Marrow is awesome to be honest. But no point ordering the the onion Marrow for an extra 5¬£. Side dish, fries, mashed potato and creamy Spinach is just very normal. Nothing fantastic about it...

Hope I'm the only customer that received such 'fantastic' treatment..."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"My friend and I were celebrating 47 years of friendship and I wanted to share this beautiful restaurant with her as she had never been. The staff were so welcoming and we had a lovely little space to ourselves. We took advantage of the Monday wine club, where corkage is ¬£5 per bottle and we had the pre theatre menu of ¬£19 for 1 course. We had steak, chips and salad and the food was perfect. Our waiter Fenil was friendly and when he found out it was a special occasion,  he organised a delicious peanut butter pastry with ice cream on the house for us to share. A very affordable meal in sumptuous surroundings."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"This is my go to lunch spot when I‚Äôm errand running in the city.

The food is good quality and service is excellent.

I had Kos as my waiter during my last visit he was charming and attentive. The level of professionalism you expect from a far more expensive restaurant."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Come for the steak, stay for the sides. Service is impeccable, the food is delicious and the restaurant is just lovely. We shared two steaks with a couple of sides, two glasses of wine, shared a dessert and a little digestif all for ~160 GBP"
Hawksmoor Air Street,1.0,"Came to celebrate for my significant other‚Äôs birthday dinner. It all went downhill the minute we were sat down. Our waitress never came back to take the order for so long that in the end we had to stop someone else to take our order, and the food didn‚Äôt even come out until over an hour and 15 minutes later. We ordered scallops and mussels for starters which were nice, but the porterhouse 800g was a disaster. It was overcooked and very rough, as if we were chewing a chunk of rock. It was very dried out for a medium rare and so tough that we cannot chew. We jokingly said to each other that the only thing enjoyable about our mains was the chips since the steak was not edible. We told the waitress about the steak, but she insisted this is how it should be. I have been to many other steak places, including hawksmoor (which I enjoyed before hence I decided to come back), which never came out medium rare to be this tough and overcooked but we were completely ignored. A celebration experience completely ruined."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Came here for dinner while in London. The vibe and decor is classic steakhouse style. We went on a Friday and it was packed! I tried their take on a classic dirty martini which included olives and spicy peppers. It was quite good. For dinner, I had the filet with b√©arnaise and added the brussel sprouts with bacon and chestnuts. The food was delicious, but it is quite expensive and the steaks all come solo and the sides have to be added a la carte. So, expect to spend $60 or more at minimum. However, it was a great meal."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Great 3 course set menu including bring your own booze (BYOB) with ¬£5 corkage. Food was good (I had a mackerel salad and steak frites as mains).
Lovely restaurant, friendly staff and a wonderful meal. Recommended!üòÉ"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Had an amazing time with my boyfriend at this restaurant for his birthday. The steak was delicious and so were the mussels too! We were pleasantly surprised by the candle and 'happy birthday' written on the plate!
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Had a great meal here on Sunday with the wife, we had visited London for the day and this was my first time visiting this restaurant in any location.

First thoughts were how big and busy the place was, wow! Second was what size steak I could fit in and still be able to walk around afterwards.

I opted for the salmon starter which was so tasty. Salmon was fresh and smokey. The wife had the dressed crab which was equally high quality with plenty of flavour.

For the main I went for the 400g rib eye cooked medium. It was bang on for me and extremely tasty, I wish I could eat one a week if I'm honest. The lady chose the beef roast dinner, the meat again was fantastic; nice and pink just as requested. Unfortunately her meal was a little cold and veg was hard so she left those bits. Overall though it was a great sitting.

We washed our dinner down with a nice bottle of red wine after a couple of cocktails before our starters to wet the whistle. The drinks menu was extensive and very high quality.

The lady waiting our table was very friendly and helpful, enjoyable company throughout our meal.

An all round great visit and I will definitely return when I'm back in London for another solid meal."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Quite noisy. The food was excellent and the staff knowledgeable and eager to help. We shared oysters and the half native lobster, while getting a main meal each. The drinks were nice as well."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Listen. Imagine a bear‚Äôs cave but that bear has a degree in interior design and doesn‚Äôt shit on the floor where it lives. Welcome to the Hawksmoor Covent Gdn, Pronouns: He/Him
A classy mancave with Parquet floors, exposed brick walls, minimal lighting, pleated glass and lots of action.
It‚Äôs in places like the Hawksmoor you wish they hadn‚Äôt banned smoking in public because a thick layer of smoke kissing the ceiling would round things off rather nicely thank you very much. It pleases me to imagine a diner with a big fat cigar in one hand, a beef rib in the other. Lost in the moment she takes a big toke on the rib before biting into her Montechristo 2. Damn you nanny state for seeing to that scenario. Still, this cellar and former brewery retains the requisite magic to believe it could happen.
The Hawksmoor concept remains achingly simple and unwavering. You come here for big steak. Porterhouse, ribeye, Tomahawk, Chateaubriand. You order chips to go with it and you order a choice of robust sides to go with the chips and you sit there squeezing in cow flesh fearlessly wherever there‚Äôs still room in the duodenum. It was a hit when it opened in Shoreditch in 2006. It‚Äôs still a hit now.
18 years sourcing and cooking basically the same thing every day has made them experts in their field. They understand the chasm between medium and medium rare. They know how to carve up a tomahawk so that all you have to do is hover your fork and decide which piece next. The effort of dropping the fork onto the meat and lifting it to the mouth requires energy and therein lies the secret of your perpetual motion.  They leave just enough meat on the bone to tempt those who understand life is too short not to grab it like a Rottweiler would if it only had hands.
A Porterhouse to share and a ribeye for birthday boy. Chunky chips all round. Sauces of peppercorn and Bernaise. Spinach - creamed for those who need lubrication to get green stuff down or a simpler lemony version. Mac and cheese for plugging any holes. But before this, just to prime the gut like a Tesla does to its battery before a supercharge, Scallops in garlic sauce and bone marrow on toast. All come in prime condition. Garlic, butter and parsley can make a garden snail edible so what‚Äôs not to like about bathing well burnished scallops in the same brew? Nothing as it turns out. Marrow comes in the shin bone that housed it sliced vertically down the middle. Two half pipes. It all slips down very easily. I‚Äôm already sweating umami.
Steaks come without pretension. The Porterhouse has been dissected, the ribeye untouched. Accompanying sauces stick without cloying. Mac and cheese is unnecessary and they knew this when they devised the menu. For this reason they make it great, just for those brave enough to take it on. Nice touches like the crispy crumb demonstrate the care. When it‚Äôs this simple it should be flawless and they oblige. The lemon in my spinach wasn‚Äôt an apology and all the better for it. That‚Äôs the key to the whole thing. No apologies. Chips are crispy, fluffy and chunky. Is there anything more you could ask from a chipped potato? The combination of these things is eminently satisfying to the extent that eating becomes painful. The machismo and bravado the Hawksmoor elicits in women and men alike  turns the meal into a war of attrition. Human v food. Human wins, just.
I remember going to the original Hawksmoor in Commercial Rd soon after it opened in 2006. I was taken aback by the quality and simplicity of the fare but less enthralled by the venue. The Hawksmoor group neatly saw to that when they opened the Covent Garden branch. It‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs simple, it‚Äôs powerful and after 18 years it‚Äôs still a thrill to descend into this cave, even if the ascent two hours later is something of a heave."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"AWESOME!!! I've been twice the last five days. If you like proper cooked meat and I mean medium rare then go. Otherwise don't  waste a prime quality meat and the time and effort of chefs... Among the best restaurants in the world. Exceptional service, nice atmosphere and outstanding food. My first time that I'm having porterhouse steak (it's the top of T-bone) and it was unbelievable tasty and juicy. We tried almost everything and every dish is full of flavour. Potted Beef & bacon and pork belly ribs are must try dishes. Definitely I highly recommend this place"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Everything about the meal was exceptional. Price point is very good but a 3 course meal with a couple of drinks for two can easily run over ¬£200-250. Its expected for the quality but with the service charge can come as a bit of a shock to some who may not be used to spending as much on a meal out.

I would say the steaks are reasonably priced however I feel the drinks and sides are a little more expensive than they should be.

However I cannot pass any fault at all to the quality of service, attentiveness of our host and the quality of the food. If you've never eaten at Hawksmoor, please make an exception to try as it is 100% worth making time for. You will not be disappointed."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Finally tried Hawksmoor Air Street and it lived up to the hype. The roasted scallops were a standout‚Äîrich and perfectly cooked. I had the rib-eye, which was smoky, tender, and full of flavor. We also shared the Chateaubriand‚Äîpricey but excellent. Sides like beef dripping chips and bone marrow gravy rounded things off nicely. Not cheap, but a great spot for a proper steak night."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"A great dinner with wonderful service from Vanesa & Team.
The mussels were excellent and would definitely have again and recommend. We shared a 900g Porterhouse which was well cooked. A bit more of nerve than I expected and next time I will take the Prime Rib.
Overall, a really great meal and excellent service. Thank you! Look forward to coming back."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Their take on a full English breakfast is only available at this Air Street branch, and on Saturdays only. I think they‚Äôve nailed the beans, harsh browns, tomatoes, mushrooms and the addition of their notable grilled marrow. It added a rich flavour that pairs beautifully with the sourdough toast.

While the honey roast gammon chop was delicious, I did find it a touch dry. The sausage was decent, but not remarkable. The gravy was also quite thin. I am not the biggest fan of black puddings anyway so unfair to judge. I think meat lovers would be craving more meat. ¬£50 for two people, we were really filled. The service was great and very friendly."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,A great Sunday roast and an even better service! The staff was amazingly friendly and polite! Thanks!
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful restaurant, very friendly well trained staff. We had the Sunday roast which was excellent, my wife loved the roast potatoes (my wife never likes roast potatoes in restaurants, so high praise). The stuffing was superb, the desserts heavenly can't wait to come back & try the steak. Their Martini is also very good."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Always great at Hawksmoor, a birthday tradition of ours. This branch in particular has great atmosphere and lovely decor. Had the fish for the first time and was not disappointed, the sea bass was very well seasoned and perfectly cooked, great if you don't feel like having meat every time. The beef fillet was beautiful but it was served very salty, so we sent it back which they accommodated graciously and brought a new dish, perfectly seasoned. They also replaced all the sides (even though we had already eaten them!).
The only small issue was the pears in the cheesecake dessert were under-ripe, to the point of tasteless, it's a beautiful dish, probably better not to put the fruit on if it's not ripe.
Highly recommend: the scallop starter, fillet/rump steaks and the creamed spinach!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,3.0,"Good food, esp the express menu. Decent atmosphere. Extremely slow service by wait staff. Food came out quick actually. I don‚Äôt see why it can be that hard to order food (had to keep asking and eventually asked another server to place the order). Your wait staff are obviously overwhelmed and understaffed"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Pro Tip: Monday is Bring-Your-Own bottle, with a corkage fee of only ¬£5.

Stepping into Hawksmoor Air Street is an immersion into sheer elegance - it's my unequivocal favourite Hawksmoor. The reception staff consistently greet you with warm smiles, setting the tone for a delightful dining experience. Ascending the marble elliptical staircase to the first floor unveils a captivating art deco interior, a huge chandelier, emerald-hued leather booths, and a meticulously restored parquet floor from an old RAF base.

While Hawksmoor has always excelled in steaks, this particular branch stands out with its expanded repertoire, featuring an array of fish dishes that rival the excellence of their renowned steaks. The steaks are perfectly cooked and properly rested as there are no juices on the plate, when they arrive My personal recommendation is the Chateaubriand this always goes down well."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"I loved atmosphere, service and most of the food. I ordered lots of dishes and was really excited about steak. That‚Äôs where bit of let down is. Steak was bit too chewy which is their specialty. I have been to Hawsmoor‚Äôs other branches and it‚Äôs my favourite steak. Loved Lobster and all of other dishes."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"I really enjoy the experience at this restaurant! I tried the beef Sunday roast, and it was delicious. The potatoes were very crispy, and the portion size was generous. The restaurant's decor transported me to the 60s, and the service was very attentive. I highly recommend it, and the prices are quite reasonable for being in Piccadilly."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"What a lovely experience! I was here for a friends birthday, and a MASSIVE SHOUT OUT to Reece and Elisia. My steak wasn‚Äôt the best, but the staff kindly made me another, and wanted to make sure we were happy. Elisia went out of her way to then give us birthday cocktails, and ensured we had a memorable night. THANK YOU!!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"My wife and I came here for our anniversary.

The food was exquisite and I would highly recommend both the non alcoholic and premium wine/beverage pairings. We were really lucky to have Isabelle guide us through our wines.

It was also lovely to find out we had extra courses but those should be a surprise (although the bread may have been the best bread course I‚Äôve ever had). Would recommend without reservation."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Our experience at Evelyn‚Äôs Table was truly special. The intimate counter setting made the evening feel personal and immersive‚Äîwatching the chefs at work added a thoughtful touch to the meal. üë®‚Äçüç≥‚ú®

The portion size was perfect‚Äîenough to feel satisfied without being overly full. We opted for the non-alcoholic pairing, which was incredibly well thought out and paired beautifully with each dish. üçπ

Two standout dishes for us were:
ü•á The crab with courgettes, almond, and elderflower‚Äîa refreshing and delicate start.
üçì And the dessert of strawberry, shiso, black sesame, and raw milk‚Äîso creative and beautifully balanced.

The service was warm and professional, and the chefs were friendly and open, making us feel welcomed throughout.

Highly recommend for a unique, refined dining experience in London. A true hidden gem. üåüüçΩÔ∏è"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"This restaurant was worth the wait, being only 12 seats means this place is hard to get a reservation for, but if you do, you are in for a magical meal.
Every dish was amazing and would recommend the wine pairing ""the path less trodden."" The team explains each dish and bottle and it shows the thought and care that has gone into each dish.
From the menu we had, the standouts were the mere trout, lamb and cr√®me br√ªl√©e but none the dishes will leave you disappointed. We can't wait to visit again."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"We had an amazing experience here. The service, the knowledge and friendliness of the sommelier and the chefs, the food. It was all really great. It was really cool to see the chefs prepare everything in front of your eyes. The only minor faults I can think of was that the duck, while really nice, was a bit chewy and definitely not at the same level as the other dishes. And the truffle add-on was not worth it at all, it didn't add much. But we will return at some point :).

P.s. this restaurant seems to be bombarded with fake 5 star reviews ATM."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"One of the best dinners I‚Äôve ever had. Every single dish was incredible, and the wine pairing was perfect. They were also amazing at accommodating my wife‚Äôs dietary requirements during her pregnancy. A perfect place for a celebratory dinner."
Evelyn's Table,3.0,"Tucked away down a side street entrance beneath a traditional pub, Evelyn‚Äôs Table is an intimate, almost hidden space. Descending a narrow staircase, you arrive in a dimly lit, compact dining area with a notably low ceiling. The room is centred around a marble chef‚Äôs counter seating just 12 guests, evoking the exclusivity of a high-end chef‚Äôs table experience. The seating area was cramped, elbows bumping and jabbing into each other and other physical encounters due to throughfare movement.

The restaurant offers a fixed tasting menu concept. I chose the pescatarian option, which ‚Äî according to the menu I was handed ‚Äî featured just one alteration from the standard selection. Everything proceeded smoothly until the main course, when I was unexpectedly served duck. For a venue of this calibre, this was a significant oversight. Serving duck to a pescatarian diner ‚Äî when an alternative (Pollock) was clearly intended ‚Äî is a serious lapse in both communication and attentiveness from the kitchen and front-of-house team.

The tasting menu itself, although advertised as five courses, was more elaborate in practice, incorporating amuse-bouches, palate cleansers, and petit fours ‚Äî making it closer to eight courses in total. In fairness, I chose not to flag the error, curious to see whether any member of staff or the chefs would notice or correct it. None did, which was disappointing.

The evening began with three amuse-bouches, the highlight being a beautifully clear brown crab broth ‚Äî delicately balanced and deeply flavourful.

Standout Dishes:
‚Ä¢ Crab, Courgette, Almond, Elderflower: A refreshing and elegant dish, where the elderflower film delicately topped a rich crab mixture subtly lifted by mayonnaise.
‚Ä¢ Mere Trout, Tomato, Cucumber, Radish: Lightly grilled or blow-torched trout, perfectly cooked but very small in portion.
‚Ä¢ Turbot, Girolle Mushrooms, Tarragon, Vin Jaune: The standout course of the evening. The sauce was reminiscent of a refined lobster bisque, and the fish was immaculate.

The main should have been the Pollock with Bobby Beans, Cherry, and Endive ‚Äî a well-balanced dish on paper. However, I was served duck instead, which was unfortunately metallic in taste, slightly chewy, and entirely out of place on a pescatarian menu. In hindsight, I regret not saying anything in the moment.

The palate cleanser, with miniature basil leaves, was creative and refreshing, followed by a beautifully presented dessert:
‚Ä¢ Peach, Raspberry, Verbena: A delightful combination, full of fresh, summer flavours.

Drinks:
‚Ä¢ The Negroni was expertly balanced, though served in a surprisingly small pour.
‚Ä¢ The Pisco Sour, by contrast, was overly sour and lacked finesse.

Conclusion:
Evelyn‚Äôs Table delivers a refined, immersive chef‚Äôs counter experience with some excellent dishes and creative touches. However, the serious error of serving duck on a pescatarian menu ‚Äî without recognition or apology ‚Äî undermines the professionalism expected at a Michelin-starred restaurant."

Evelyn's Table,5.0,"There are one Michelin Starred restaurants and then there‚Äôs Evelyn Table where the experience and the food is just more than flawless technique and execution. The warmth of the staff hugs you like a cozy blanket making you feel at ease, and this includes the Chefs, taking the time to diligently explaining every single dish to each diner, one by one, with a friendly smile on their face. Every dish is a masterclass of delicacy, and yet familiar and comforting. Sometimes you get ‚Äúsecret courses‚Äù between dishes and one notable one we had was the home made sourdough Bread. Yes, we were left in awe by something so simple like a bread course: the texture was incredible and there were so many layered flavour exciting the tongue one after the other, from the nuttiness of the fermented butter that accompanied it to the smoky after taste, so simple yet so unexpected! One thing is for sure, Evelyn‚Äôs Table deserve a second Michelin Star. Immediately."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,Attended Evelyn‚Äôs table for my birthday dinner. We had the set table top menu which was beautiful paired with local UK wines and even a sake. Would recommend if you like fresh light seasonal produce.

Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Had a wonderful meal here! Loved the open kitchen + chef‚Äôs table feel of the restaurant. Every dish impressive and consistently good. Service was smooth and the som very knowledgeable, worthy of their michelin star ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Evelyn's Table,5.0,"An amazing experience with phenomenal Chefs! We celebrated birthdays and every part of the dining experience exceeded our expectations.

Evelyn's Table,5.0,Omg what can i say but wow.  Not only was the service amazing but the staff and food was outstanding.  The ambience and all round great feeling this restaurant provided was great. My new regular spot to eat and share a bottle of wine with my girls. Definitely recommend üëåüèº

Evelyn‚Äôs table was another notch. Above love the decor. The food  spot on  every where I looked were smiles. Gasps how good it is
Not happens very often but quality quantity  and pricing
I was made to feel it was all about me staff amazing  I‚Äôm going again and again"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"An unforgettable experience that transcends dining‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey for the senses and the soul. Evelyn‚Äôs Table is more than a Michelin-starred restaurant; it‚Äôs a place where food becomes art, and emotions take center stage. One particular dessert, with its delicate white chocolate notes, transported me straight back to my childhood‚Äîa testament to the power of culinary storytelling.

Each dish is a masterpiece, from the aromatic Cornish Pollack to the exquisite Mallard, presented with precision and passion. The wine pairings were equally extraordinary‚Äîeach glass came with its own story, like a captivating bedtime tale for adults, perfectly complementing the meal.

The open kitchen adds to the magic. Watching the chefs work in seamless harmony, creating dishes with such finesse and without a sound, is nothing short of mesmerizing. The waitstaff are equally remarkable‚Äîattentive, knowledgeable, and committed to ensuring you feel utterly pampered.

We floated on a cloud the entire evening, completely immersed in the experience. This is, without a doubt, one of the finest restaurants I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of visiting. I hope these words do justice to the brilliance of Evelyn‚Äôs Table."
Evelyn's Table,2.0,"One of the worst service ive had for a michelin star restaurant. Two girls on duty the night we went. They collect your plates without asking if youre done. Ordered a bottle of wine and they didnt serve us till we asked for it. Left our bottle of white wine at room temp and did not serve us till i had to ask if we had any wine left. The remaining of our white ended up warm‚Ä¶
Kitchen staff were cleaning right after main was served. Wasnt very pleasant seeing them scrub the stains while we were still eating. The room was very hot and stuffy and people not customers from the restaurant would use the toilet so the toilet was dirty like public toilet.

Lastly, they DO NOT reply emails. it‚Äôs crazy. I emailed them 3 times, even dm ed them and no reply. What kind of michelin service is this. dont think they deserve a star at all."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,the only fine dinning experience that i would say is worth every penny. i am definitely coming here again.
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"Generally I dislike the 'chef's table' experience but staff were warm, friendly and attentive.  The food and drinks pairings were surprisingly good and the food was certainly better than expected.  Great presentation- worth a visit."
Evelyn's Table,3.0,Overall good experience / decent quality but I think it‚Äôs overrated on Google/social media. The summer menu feels to me a very strong association and seasoning with seaweed (from starter to main dish) which is both very sweet and savoury (probably too salty). So unfortunately I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a balanced and well designed menu.
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Evelyn's Table is celebrated for its exceptional tasting menu and expertly paired wines. Guests consistently praise the refined flavors, fresh ingredients, and creatively presented dishes. The ambiance is described as intimate and relaxed, making it an ideal spot for a special meal. Staff are noted for being knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Lovely little spot with only a dozen seats.

Everything was great, but I especially enjoyed that:
- each course was served and explained by the chef or one of the other two cooks
- it's super easy to see what is happening in the kitchen since it's right there and the seating is high enough to be able to see everything
- the staff asked us casually why we were in London, then ended up giving us a card at the end congratulating us on our anniversary. I hadn't mentioned that during the booking so they did it spontaneously.
- they had a non alcoholic pairing with some interesting drinks, some home made"
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"On paper this place ticks all my favourite boxes.

Was it my favourite place, no, was it good, yes but it could have been soo much more.

It's a nice experience, the setting it great, intimate, you feel special but...

It was the first tasting menu that I was hungry afterwards, the chef interactions were pretty poor, it was expensive and didn't feel it valued the bill at the end.

We did have a nice time, our waitress was fantastic, and it was a good group of people at the table.

Tucked beneath a quiet pub on Rupert Street, Evelyn‚Äôs Table feels like London‚Äôs best-kept secret. With just 12 seats wrapped around a chef‚Äôs counter, it‚Äôs intimate, dimly lit, and quietly theatrical. You‚Äôre not just eating ‚Äî you‚Äôre part of the kitchen‚Äôs rhythm.

The vibe is calm, creative, and deeply personal. Chefs talk you through each dish with warmth and precision, while soft music and candlelight set the tone. It‚Äôs upscale, but never stiff ‚Äî more like dining in a friend‚Äôs (very talented) home kitchen.

Expect seasonal, modern British food with global touches, served with care and soul. Book fast ‚Äî seats go quickly.

Vibe: Intimate, creative, quietly cool
Perfect for: Food lovers, anniversaries, solo indulgence"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Evelyn‚Äôs Table is a hidden gem. The intimate setting makes it feel really special, and the food is outstanding ‚Äî creative, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. Service is warm and attentive without being overbearing. Perfect spot for a memorable evening. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Seating wise was slightly crammed, but other than that, everything else was perfect. We were extremely full by the end of it and enjoyed most of our courses."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"I had a lovely experience at this restaurant. The food was fresh and full of flavor, especially the grilled chicken and house-made sauces. The staff were friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The atmosphere was warm and relaxing ‚Äî perfect for a casual dinner or small celebration. Definitely worth a visit!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Here, guests can watch the chefs meticulously prepare each course, which I personally am a fan of, as this close interaction with the chefs offers a rare glimpse into the behind the scenes of every dish, making each bite even more special."
Evelyn's Table,3.0,"Not worth it to try. Not at the level of Michelin one star. Only the appetizer is good. 5 course on the memu are very ordinary, Third course Very saltyÔºàVeryÔºÅÔºÅÔºâ  Pork is very dry abd difficult to chew. I didn't expect this level of food to be rated Michelin star. There's one more important thing‚ö†Ô∏è the final dessert with cleaning the countertop togetherÔºÅjust next to each other. The hygiene situation is worrying."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"Evelyn‚Äôs Table is located under a busy bar in Soho, very close to Chinatown.
The menu changes every two weeks, offering customers a varied experience.
Tonight, I tried the Scottish native lobster and  Cornish pollock, along with tender pork belly, beautiful peach raspberry desert‚Äîvery new English style . Surprisingly, you have to pay for the 5-course tasting menu before your visit. The food was cooked to perfection, top quality, and it was a lovely time for dinner between 8:45 PM and 11:00 PM."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"I was a bit nervous booking this for a special occasion given that the reviews are either 5/5 or someone saying that people are being paid to leave 5* reviews. We had a lovely time at Evelyn‚Äôs table but I did feel that it was quite overpriced, especially for the wine pairings which weren‚Äôt particularly tasty and included a foul sake. The plates were very small, while meticulously crafted, and it was very cool to be able to watch the chefs preparing the dishes, however I would say overall that I‚Äôve had better fine dining experiences."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Evelyn‚Äôs Table is a hidden gem ‚Äî intimate, refined, and unforgettable. The chef‚Äôs tasting menu is beautifully curated, with every dish showcasing creativity and bold, balanced flavors. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and warm, creating a relaxed yet elevated experience. From start to finish, it felt personal and a true culinary experience, not just a meal. Easily one of the best dining experiences in London"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"We had a great time at Evelyn‚Äôs Table. All dishes are well presented and explained by the lovely staff. Can only recommend, it‚Äôs a great experience, amazing food and great playlist. The team even reserved a table for us for a pre dinner drink in their wine bar upstairs. Only point to mention is that we felt a bit rushed - they have two sittings a night at 6 and 8.45pm."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Adorable intimate dining, only a dozen or so seats and all at a counter overlooking the chef's working, great experience, food was exceptional, staff were super friendly and informative. Highly recommend the half-half on the drinks pairing that way you can venture into more adventurous drinks!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,Very good experience. They have maintained its quality since the start 6-7years ago. Really loved the wine options and the hospitality from even before starting dinner. Was a personal fan that they have a couple of Sake options
Evelyn's Table,5.0,The best food I have ever tasted!!!! So worth it!
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"What can I say... I've been to various different restaurants in London, many Michelin Stars and nothing came close to this.

The attention to detail, the outstanding service, the ambience, the care and the small details made this an absolutely remarkable night.

I couldn't believe that all the chefs actually signed a birthday card and handed it to my girlfriend for her birthday.

Thank you so much to all the staff, you guys are the best."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"A very good restaurant with excellent tasty food, all served by a pleasant courteous and hospitable staff.
I loved eating here, and I will return soon to taste again the culinary delights.
A very lovely experience."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Good experience from start to finish.
The food was exceptional, Staff attentive and the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming. A lovely place to have a cozy evening. Surely recommend it for anyone that wants value for their money."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,This was one of my favorite tasting meals of all time! The chefs were polite and interesting in their introductions and placement of food. The service was perfectly timed and paced. Very fresh take on ingredients and flavors. It felt closer to a 2 Michelin star restaurant. Thank you for a wonderful and memorable meal!
Evelyn's Table,5.0,A wonderful tasting menu experience. My guest doesn't eat red meat and they were very accommodating. Great friendly service. Highly recommend.
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Absolutely superb. I had high expectations and they were surpassed. Unless you really hate counter seating (and the seats here are relatively comfortable for counter seats), you are going to love this place. Service was spot on, atmosphere was just right, food was consistently divine throughout the meal and pricing was what you would expect at this level (dinner for two with a pairing and service came in at slightly under ¬£500 - of course that's an extravagant sum, but if there's a special occasion and you value fine dining, I'd highly recommend)"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"It‚Äôs definitely one of the best Michelin starred restaurants dinning experienced I had.

British produce, and Scandinavian and Japanese techniques and classic French touches.

It‚Äôs really difficult for me to decide which dish is the highlight of the day.

Worth visiting and will come back again ü§©"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"What a fabulous evening and amazing gourmet experience! The food was delicious, the wines excellent and paired perfectly, and the service flawless. The setting is unique and intimate, contributing to the overall experience with the food being prepared in front of you. Truly one of the biggest highlights of our London dining adventures."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"We really enjoyed this restaurant and rate it really highly. The menu is mostly fish, so best for any fish lovers. The restaurant is very small so it is definitely wise to book in advance. However it isn‚Äôt too busy if you want a pre-theatre option, try arriving before 6 and see if they have a spare table. If you do make it here, you MUST try the ragu and the lemon tart, both were truly exceptional."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Was in London over the weekend for a family reunion and was recommended Evelyn's Table, and we were so glad we went on Friday Night. The atmosphere Decor and food was amazing. Would highly recommend definitely a 5 start dining."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic restaurant, food and staff are outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble. I will definitely be returning. Thanks again."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant food and wine compliment each other. The atmosphere is just out of this world.
The ambience is electrifying.
It's a must to go place as a couple or by yourself.. There's plenty to do before you tuck in..."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,I booked it for me and a female friend and we had such a good time we're more than friends now. Service was great and the food was amazing. Very classy. We will be definitely going back.
Evelyn's Table,1.0,"I've visited Evelyn's Table twice before when it was run by the Selby brothers. This year, James Goodyear took over as head chef. The format remains the same, with a tasting menu featuring five main courses and two accompanying snacks. The dishes retain some Japanese elements in their seasoning. While the flavors weren't as impressive as my previous visits, they were still quite good overall.

However, my experience was marred when I found a wriggling insect in my bowl while eating the Day Boat Fish dish. Likely it came from the decorative plants. When I informed the chef, he brought over James, who after examining the bug, removed it with tweezers and crushed it, assuring me it was just the skin of a bean and not to worry.

I can understand the occasional insect in organic vegetables, and even if they explained that they couldn't replace the dish due to limited servings, I'd understand. However, simply destroying the evidence and offering such an explanation made me feel unpleasant."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Getting a reservation at Evelyn's Table feels like finding a golden ticket, and the experience more than lives up to the immense hype. Tucked away in the cellar of The Blue Posts pub in Soho, this is not just a meal; it's pure culinary theatre.

From the moment you descend the stairs, you leave the bustle of London behind and enter an intimate sanctuary dedicated to food. With only a handful of seats wrapped around the kitchen counter, you have a front-row view of the magic. Watching the small team of incredibly talented chefs work with such precision, calm, and passion is a performance in itself.

The tasting menu was a sublime journey through the very best of seasonal British produce, exquisitely elevated with Japanese precision and classic French techniques. Each course was a work of art, both visually stunning and a symphony of perfectly balanced flavours. A standout for us was a delicate dish of Cornish seabass with a subtle citrus dressing that was simply unforgettable, followed by a piece of Iberico pork so perfectly rendered it melted in your mouth.

What truly sets Evelyn's Table apart is the interaction with the chefs. They present each dish personally, explaining the ingredients, the inspiration, and the cooking process with genuine enthusiasm. It creates a connection to the food that you simply don't get in a traditional restaurant setting. The optional wine pairing was expertly curated, with each glass thoughtfully chosen to complement and enhance the dishes.

This is an experience for a special occasion, for a true food lover, for anyone who wants to be reminded of how powerful and exciting food can be. Yes, booking is a challenge, but it is worth every ounce of effort. Evelyn's Table is a true jewel in London's culinary crown, and I am already plotting how to get back. Unforgettable."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"A lovely restaurant with a top notch services. The food was delicious, the staff were kind, and the place felt warm and welcoming. I had a wonderful time and would love to come back again."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"I cannot fault the food, it was exceptional. Particularly the trout which was sublime. Service was also exceptional. However I'm a wine lover and the pairing was beyond bad at ¬£80 I expect the the best given we getting 125ml per course. The intrusion of a cider was nonsensical, it was bubbles all the way down and mostly white with the only red tasting flat, I'm not even going to mention the dessert wine. If you go, order a bottle of wine and be done with it, cos the food is fantastic üòç"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Evelyn‚Äôs Table isn‚Äôt just a restaurant‚Äîit‚Äôs a secret portal to a parallel universe where food tells stories, wine speaks fluent poetry, and chefs move like culinary ninjas in an open kitchen ballet.

I came for dinner, but left wondering if I‚Äôd just attended an edible opera.

The Cornish Pollack was so delicately seasoned, I half expected it to recite Shakespeare. The Mallard? A moody, brooding masterpiece with the kind of flavor depth that deserves its own novel. And then came that dessert‚Äîwhite chocolate sorcery that whisked me back to my childhood faster than a time machine made of sugar.

Wine pairings? Think bedtime stories for grown-ups‚Äîexcept instead of tucking you in, they wake up every one of your taste buds and ask them to dance. The service was so smooth, I briefly questioned if the staff were psychic.

In short: Evelyn‚Äôs Table is less ‚Äúdinner out‚Äù and more ‚Äúspiritual awakening via fork.‚Äù Would I go again? I‚Äôm already planning my next pilgrimage."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"5 Stars
Excellent service and a truly original experience! I loved the atmosphere‚Äîit's in a fantastic spot, tucked away just enough to feel really special. A hidden gem that makes you feel like you've discovered something unique. 100% recommended!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"The most incredible experience. Cannot fault the service, food and incredible atmosphere, everything was perfect! We loved the langoustine and venison in particular, but were blown away by every course. The sommelier and chefs were so lovely when explaining our pairings and dishes - Book in advance and absolutely make this a must visit. Thank you!!!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Beautiful, intimate setting and seeing the Selby brothers in action at the kitchen counter seats! The menu during my visit seemed to be Japanese influenced, which was right up my alley. Every set was commendable and the flavours all combined well together! Will definitely be back."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,This dining experience was absolutely outstanding. We've had the opportunity to eat at some world class restaurants... and this was absolutely one our top (some 3* ones really pale in comparison). Loved it and can't recommend highly enough.
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"After hearing about Evelyn‚Äôs table from a friend we decided to book a table for two for dinner after attending the theatre in soho with my partner and I. Located in the heart of the west end next to Leicester Square, we made our way to be seated at Evelyn‚Äôs table upon arrival we were warmly greeted, after being lead through the establishment by the front of house we were amazed by its rich history and elegance. Our five-course evening tasting menu for ¬£135 per person was out of this world, compliments to the chef and front of house the scallops to start were beyond delicious and our main course was out of this world. Evelyn‚Äôs was a great experience and highly recommended 5 stars all round."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"üò≥ wowzas! I‚Äôve been to some incredible restaurants, but this was something else. The intimate basement setting was the perfect stage to this culinary experience. Watching the chefs at work, both mastering the kitchen and hosting the guests in a personal, fun manner brings the whole evening to life. The delicately curated dishes were a sensation on the eyes as well as the taste buds. My favourite part however, has to be the wine pairing and the deeply thoughtful and eloquent introduction to the vineyard, production technique and grape, the sake was like nothing I‚Äôd have before, the sommelier was so passionate and warm. A really unique and special place. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Wonderful experience.
We stayed in this intimate restaurant and it was all wonderful.
mennu made up of 5 courses and recommend pairing with wine.
Everything was perfect from eating to drinking to serving.
Very nice to eat and see the chefs cooking for you and the very knowledgeable sommelier put us at ease.
Really Recommend!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"A truly unforgettable dining experience.
The food was exceptional, the service was warm and attentive, and the atmosphere was intimate and beautifully curated. Every course was creative and full of flavor. Highly recommended for a special night out."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"There aren‚Äôt words to describe how wonderful dinner was at Evelyn‚Äôs Table. They should have more than one Michelin star. The entire experience was perfection from the second we walked in the door. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, the chefs were very personable while making mind blowingly good food. Every dish was fantastic and the wine pairing was very unique and exploratory. Even the music selection was perfectly executed for the feeling of the space and the meal. It is worth every penny and second invested in having a meal here."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"The cuisine menu was adorned with an array of Japanese-inspired elements: varsity uses of miso, fish roe, seaweed, etc. all intricately woven into the dishes to add nuanced touches rather than dominate, maintaining a European fusion essence.

Started with an exquisite two-ways of Cornish fish appetizer, which was, without a doubt, my highlight of the evening. The warm dish was a marvel of texture and taste‚Äîtender fish enveloped in konbu leaves, roasted to achieve a perfect balance of moisture retention and flavor infusion. The sauce was a delicate blend of fish roe and seaweed powder that enhanced the umami, making the warm dish an embrace of comfort. The cold dish offered a refreshing contrast, with sashimi brought to life with leeks and a zesty apple sauce.

Continued with a first main course of Iberico pork, showcasing three distinct cuts‚Äîshoulder, butt, and leg‚Äîdrizzled with basil leaf oil. The dish was paired with a non-alcoholic drink left a lingering spiciness, courtesy of jalape√±o, that was nothing short of mesmerizing.

The second main dish scallop sliced and accompanied with four distinct methods of swede preparation. Sourdough and beetroot cream cheese came to transition between courses, striking a rare balance.

The final Lake District venison served a decent conclusion to the main courses, although didn't quite captivate as the previous dishes had.

The predessert rejuvenated the tasting experience‚Äîlemon jelly and panne cotta-alike milk custard accompanied by a trio of honey and fruits embodies a balance of sweet and sour.

The dessert, ambitiously combined the homemade vanilla ice cream and hot truffle caramel sauce, was a bit overwhelming, at least to our tolerance. The intention was bold, but the presence of black truffle felt out of place, casting a shadow over the otherwise harmonious blend of red beans and ice cream.

Overall, I enjoy the boldness of experiencing the combination of different flavours, truest adventurous and worth tryingü´∂"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"When a friend suggested joining her at Evelyn‚Äôs Table, I wasn‚Äôt sure as it seems expensive. But I am so happy I decided to go. The food was amazing, service mostly good. Each dish explained and everything a pleasure except perhaps dessert on the day we went (far too cloyingly sweet) but every other dish was spot on! Atmosphere (ie other diners) was rather subdued as there was an air of quiet seriousness about food (I think we were given a couple of looks for laughing as we were chatting - but it was just the day we went. It is a 12-seater restaurant so very dependent on who is there on that sitting). All in all I would recommend going at least once.
PS you can arrive early and have a drink at their bar upstairs."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"The best meal I've had this year to date. Super cosy atmosphere with mega friendly staff and chefs who you are inches from as they prepare the food. The tuna tartare was next level and the hake with sweet corn was the meal of the night. So tasty and balanced to perfection. The wine the waitress helped us choose was perfect. We were on a tight time frame so don't expect to while away the hours here, but if you're looking for excellent food, excellent drinks and excellent service, then give this place a bash."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Really great restaurant, with a pop up feeling and counter like seatings. Food is exceptional and the menu has a variety enough of dishes, including fresh fish well explained by the chef, we could chose between hake, cod or crab. Wine list it's pretty good as well. Price value quality could be one of the best at the moment. Puddings options are available as well in case you have a sweet tooth."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"Some of the dishes were excellent, but the space felt cramped."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"OMG ! The picture will talk for themselves... It tasted even better than it looks.
The service is outstanding (Just make sure to not be late to avoid being a bit rushed by the waiters), the drinks good and the chef brings the food to the next level. Good value for money. The concept of 11 seats only and the dinner at the counter make this a full and unique foodie experience."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Relaxed, informal and extremely delicious. We loved the way you can chat to every chef as they each take turns to present different courses. Super place I would love to go back in the future. We also had a pre dinner seating at the wine bar upstairs which is a must to get the full experience, the sommelier is top class."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"A marvellous meal.

To ensure a relaxed seating process (and likely upsell of decent plonk) you‚Äôll most likely be escorted to the wine bar upstairs before you are seated in the basement restaurant space. Do not fill up on the addictive bar snacks (come back when you‚Äôre not dining downstairs)

I‚Äôve been a fan of the food from this restaurant group for years - the menu's not cheap but the food is consistently good which is a mark of quality. The last time we ventured downstairs the food was Italian, tasty but pricey and as we kept ordering to try more dishes it ended up being quite pricey.

This visit we found the front of house team at Evelyn‚Äôs Table the right amount of friendly and the chefs good natured in the face of a silly amount of cellphones during service (which I too am guilty of)

Like most good tasting menus, you‚Äôll find yourself pleasantly full despite the Lilliputian portions. Whilst the  ‚Äúsecret‚Äù slash ‚Äúbonus‚Äù dishes (sorry, courses) deliver the perception of value, they‚Äôre so fun and tasty you‚Äôll wish there are more ‚Äúhidden‚Äù courses.

Recommended for those who genuinely like food and flavours,  British seasonal produce with a typically London mix of flavours and cuisine and aren‚Äôt looking to be seen and just want a nice dinner. The price point makes it more of an occasion than a weekly dinner, and I‚Äôm looking forward to visiting each season for a pay day treat"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Unreal experience, food was amazing, chefs attention to details is well noticed. Front of house are brilliant and recommend great wine."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Could really not have loved this anymore. An intimate experience, delicious food, excellent service, passionate chefs and sommeliers‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve definitely paid more for less fabulous tasting menus. Will definitely be back next season! Thanks to everyone in the team for such a lovely evening"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"This is a difficult to get type of restaurant. The space is an intimate basement 12 seater counter with 3 chefs that cook and present their creation in front of you, and 2 sommeliers that guide you through the possible combinations of wine pairing. We were 2 and chose the traditional pairing and the ‚Äúnatural wine‚Äù pairing in order to explore the taste and flavour combinations. The food is extremely good, the flavours range from modern to classic to experimental, with mods to seasonality, Asian influences, modern British, techniques are classic like the usage of beurre blanc, salsify, yuzu and other touches that let you grasp the complexity of the cooking which went into each carefully prepared dish. They have 2 seatings, we had the 6 pm one, and there is another at 8 pm if I remember correctly. The tasting of Cornish fish to start with was sublime, followed by an
Outstanding British iberico presa dish, the Orkney scallop and the venison with mushroom and smoked juniper, some stout bread with a cr√®me fraiche and beets ( delicious) plus the Jerusalem artichoke dessert followed by a chocolate log with a ganache of hazelnut inside. The service is great, attentive, and full of enthusiasm, the 2 sommelier are both passionate, competent and fun to interact with, the chefs are friendly and very polite, the food is incredible. The only suggestion I have is to have a dedicated pastry chef, as the desserts are the last part of the meal, and I thought that, albeit being good, they were not as delicious as the mains. Anyway, the dinner was magical and I am looking forward to see this place gaining a 2nd Michelin star !"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,Amazing place family friendly! My child is very picky but staff was amazing to help find what is the best option for her. Food was delicious..thank you definitely will come back soon
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant! Loved everything, and the service is insanely good, best I have had in ages, so huge thanks to our waiter for being so awesome! :) food great, champagne amazing, cocktails perfect ü•∞  will defo be going back. üëå"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"The place was recommended by our friend and probably that is why we hoped for amazing experiences. The food was ok, nicely served, but nothing more. The place is all right, the atmosphere is intimate, although the tables are close together, but it doesn't bother. There is a button at the table to order champagne.
We were told to make reservation so we did. It wasn't full.
It took us 40 minutes to get to the restaurant from our hotel and we passed many good looking restaurants on the way and maybe that's why we don't know how to appreciate this place"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Party of three came here for a birthday dinner and we loved it!
We had been meaning to try this spot for years and it did not disappoint. The venue is beautiful, and the decorations and interior design are mindful in creating a retro style that feels like a break from 21st century London.
As a starter, got the scallop, lobster and shrimp pelmeni which were simply mind blowing; the flavours were distinguishable but blended great with the lobster bisquet.
As mains, we got the steak tartare and tuna tartare to share which were also delicious; the quality of the product was noticeable and we especially recommend the tuna tartare, which is served with a soy and citrus dressing which really elevates the plate and brings out the richness of the tuna. We also got a main serving of the truffle potato and mushroom vareniki, which was rich, earthy and tasty.
For desserts, we ordered the flaming creme br√ªl√©e which was frankly perfect, and the BBR Signature Chocolate Glory, which was a whole experience, tasting different chocolates with different textures and not too overwhelmingly sweet. Additionally, since we came for a birthday, they brought a complementary dessert with a candle to blow.
The service was outstanding; the waiters are attentive and kind, making the experience even more enjoyable.
Would recommend for any special occasion, 10/10!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Bob Bob Ricard, the original in Soho, is opulent, glamorous, and playful inspired by the Golden Age of travel and luxurious train carriages like the Orient Express.

The food and drinks were all excellent, our table had prawn cocktails, oysters with vodka shots and smoked salmon for starters. Mains were beef tartare, fish pie and lemon so, all delicious.

Our waiter Danny was very smartly presented and provided just the right level of service and entertainment! Thank you, you were the magic ingredient that made it a memorable evening.

The restiarant design features a mix of Art Deco and retro elements, with rich colors, plush seating, and plenty of mirrored surfaces. A key element is the ""Press for Champagne"" button at each table, which adds to the sense of playful luxury.

The decor incorporates creates a sense of stepping back in time.  The entire dining room is comprised of booths, reminiscent of dining cars on a luxurious train.  Each booth is equipped with the famous ""Press for Champagne"" button, summoning bottles of champagne to the table.  Marble tabletops, brass finishes, and copper accents add to the lush feel.

Like this review if you find it helpful!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,3.0,"The atmosphere is great, it‚Äôs a throw back to many years ago.  The disappointing part is they may be leaning on the building history and haven‚Äôt improved with the times.  The food was average and service was less than expected for the price point.  It may be focusing on champagne buttons instead of high quality food and service."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Visited with a party of 10 coworkers and we all had a brilliant evening. Our server, Fidan, was friendly, funny, and accurate with his recommendations. Exceptional service.

The food was good, although the portions are small ‚Äî as you‚Äôd expect from such a place. Definitely try the sticky toffee pudding. The Champagne button was a fun novelty and the decor was lively and somewhat quirky as the theme was Wes Anderson‚Äôs film, Phoenician Scheme.

Overall a good place to dine (particularly if your company is footing the bill!) and a big kudos to Fidan for making it extra memorable."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Service was wonderful, staff were warm and friendly. I asked for an unusual coffee (in the UK); not a problem.

Loved it."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,Me and my friend were interested in eating the Beef Wellington. It Takes around 45min/1h to cook. It‚Äôs worth every minute. The manager Ricardo is a true gentleman and very competent.
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,2.0,"This one is hard for me to review.  On the day we visited, I was very pleased that we went there. It looked like a great place for special occasions, full of charm and a luxurious, calm atmosphere.  Booth seating added privacy and intimacy to a dining experience.  The staff was friendly and attentive and helped to decide what to order, but service of the food was very slow, considering the fact that the restaurant was not busy. I really wanted to try the Beef Wellington, but it only can be ordered for two, and my dining party had different idea what to order. I wasn't very impressed by the menu choices though. We ordered Steak tartare as a starter, Cottage pie, and Stinking Bishop Cheese Souffl√© with Truffle chips as a main courses. Although it was said on the menu that  souffl√©  can be ordered as a main, it was a starter and shouldn't be offended as a main. It was tasty,  and it filled me up, but after couple spoonfuls I wished I ordered something from main menu. The Cottage pie was delicious. What ruined all the good memories was a horrible food poisoning with a torrential diarrhea that both of us had next day after sharing stake tartare for starter. It took me over a week to recover and lots of painkillers day and night. Wouldn't recommend anyone."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"BBR is somewhat struggling with being too popular. Dinner seating is capped at 2hrs which is hardly enough to consume starters, mains and desserts accompanied with drinks. We experienced being rushed along a bit by the staff which obviously isn't what you're looking for during dinner. That aside the food is great (beef tartare and beef wellington highly recommended) and absolutely warrants a visit. When our time was up we were lucky to get seats at the bar and stayed for another three hours as the atmosphere is really nice and drinks are good. Unfortunate dinner reservations couldn't be for three hours instead of two."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We visited during the Wes Anderson Phonecian Scheme ""Marseille Bob"" collaboration and I adored it - the bar was quiet when we visited at 6pm for some post-theatre drinks, so we got to really soak in the atmosphere and drink at our own pace.
We tried all of the alcoholic collaboration drinks and found them all not only tasty, but visually pleasing - the Hand Grenade was refreshing and smooth, and the black ""Tycoon"" drink even had a gimmick where it was ""tested for poison"" and turned black. Bottoms up!
Whether or not you're into Wes Anderson, I think this cocktail bar has a lot of personality and is worth a visit."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We really enjoyed the pre-theater set menu of salmon tartare, filet mignon and creme br√ªl√©e. We added oysters with caviar which were delicious. I have a gluten intolerance so our server provided a delicious gluten-free bread with the tartare. The filet was cooked a perfect medium-rare and we added truffle mash and green beans on the side, which were a must. While we didn't press the button for champagne, that was a cute touch and was very popular with the other tables. Bob Bob Ricard also has a great list of N/A cocktails and bubbly for those who don't drink. We were also pleased with the lovely service. While we originally booked a bar seat, the host was able to get us a table once we arrived. If you're prepared to spend $$$ for a nice meal, you can't go wrong here. But if you'd like to stay on budget, the set menu is a great price on its own."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Dining at Bob Bob Ricard on a Wednesday evening was a wonderful experience. When we arrived around 18:30 we were guided downstairs to a beautifully decorated room and the fact that it was almost empty added a really special touch to the ambience. The highlight apart from the decor was the incredibly friendly service, the waiter who was looking after our table was very pleasant and always came back to check on us at the perfect time. The food was also delightful, the mains were tasty but the dessert in particular stood out to me - both the cr√®me br√ªl√©e and the souffl√© were just perfect. Overall the combination of food, ambience and service made this a five star worthy experience for me."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"What a stylish hidden gem of a bar/restaurant and to be able to try champagne by the glass that you wouldn‚Äôt normally be able to find is a real treat. However, we thought the food was a little expensive, although excellent.."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,1.0,"This was the last time that I will ever eat at this restaurant!
My family and I have never been so rudely treated by a member of  staff (manager )within an establishment like this !Marco was the rudest  most confrontational person I have ever met! All other members of staff were great !
3 members of the dining party ordered chateaubriand which arrived with a cold sauce on all 3 , they were all sent  back to the kitchen and like all 5 star establishments thought that 3 new dishes were being made.
Instead the same 3 pieces of meat were sent back out to us 10 minutes later but my piece of meat that I had sliced into was given to my daughter !!!! This is absolutely disgusting on every level of health and hygiene!!
And the level of customer services from Marco was appalling, to say that meat can be re cooked and sent back out is wrong and then to accuse us off being rude because we were complaining about the standard of food is shocking !!!

I shall be contacting the health and safety agency for this borough over this issue.
This establishment used to be so good but will never set foot in one ever again."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,2.0,"Very disappointing experience. We decided to visit Bob Bob Ricard on a whim to check out their Phoenician Scheme themed pop-up bar. Apparently they'd 'transformed' their red room to resemble elements of the film... what they'd actually done was put a few fez hats on the waiters and offered a very small themed cocktail list with pretzels as bar snack. The cocktails were, to be fair very nice. The service, however, was incredibly poor for a place that puts a 14.5% service charge and ¬£1 per person cover charge on the bill. Firstly, the waiter that gave us our themed cocktails said not a word to us or indeed looked at us. My cocktail required a few drops of blue liquor from a pipette, a nice fun touch, but administered silently, sans the fun. The pretzels we ordered never arrived. We reminded our waiter but eventually our mains came out and so asked for them to be cancelled from our order. The waiter then confessed that he had meant to tell us the pretzels were finished but he'd forgotten. The chicken Kiev was nice, the fries were poor, the √©clair for dessert was so laughably small. Everything was overpriced. They have two martini cocktails - the mini Bob martini and the regular one. I had to double check they hadn't given me the mini by mistake because it was so tiny; I can only imagine the mini is a mere thimble.

For an establishment charging such hefty prices they either need to do better (improve the service and the food quality) or reduce their prices significantly. I dont recommend this place, and we won't be returning."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"This place is a true London institution. I finally visited recently on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. I had a 50% off the entire bill offer so it was the ideal time to visit.

Venue - 2 floors.

Decor - Nice, elegant, French-inspired smart brasserie. The lower-ground floor has a more opulent feel to it

Menu - Great selection. Something for everyone.

Cocktails - Very nice.

Food - Very good. The Chicken and Champagne pie was excellent, although I recommend ordering a side of mash to give the meal more balance. My partner had the Cottage Pie. It was on the small size however it tasted delicious. I opted for the whisky truffles for dessert. I was disappointed by their size as I was expecting something slightly larger although they tasted wonderful and I could really taste the whisky.

Service - Was good and attentive, even though it was slightly on the haughty side.
I did find it irritating that a waitress was cleaning cutlery and loudly dropping them into a drawer. I'm sure she didn't realise the noise it was creating, however the sound of metal clanging does not create a great atmosphere, especially when the restaurant is near-empty. It may sound like I am being overly fussy however I do think a little care and thought to the guest experience is lacking in these situations."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,Lovely lunchtime meal. Had the set menu which was the perfect size and had something for all of us. Really reasonable in terms of price for the food which meant we could splash out on the champagne! Very friendly relaxed service in a delightful art deco setting. Totally recommend for a treat.
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Our server was fabulous, I wish we had gotten his name, and the beef wellington for 2 was delicious. We enjoyed everything about our time dining here (and yes we did push the button for champagne). Highly recommend!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,1.0,"We got the ‚Äúset menu‚Äù of 3 courses. The portion sizes were a sad joke for how incredibly tiny they were. We had to order extra with the mains because the steak only came with sauce so the ‚Äúset menu‚Äù was ¬£34 plus ¬£7-8.

We ordered a Puglian wine that retails for ¬£12.50 that these charlatans were peddling for ¬£49. I ordered bread so we wouldn‚Äôt be starving when we left. The bill was a whopping ¬£203.00 with a ¬£25.00 service charge that I asked to have removed.

Maybe they should rename themselves
‚ÄúRob Rob Ricard‚Äù for how they gouge you without actually feeding you."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"A lovely experience. Reservations require $100 per person hold on credit card, but you pay the difference after the bill arrives. As long as you understand that prior, it is a great place to have an intimate upscale dining experience."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The food was incredible, one of the best places we have eaten in London, the drinks were just as great and the service was amazing. I would highly recommend anyone to visit this restaurant, we feel the money was well spent and totally worth it for the experience."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Heard this restaurant had the best Beef Wellington in town so we had to try it. Made a reservation months in advance for a bar counter top because we dined in on a Saturday night. It was quite busy and someone on the bar counter top wanted to switch to a table but it was fully reserved. We started off with some drinks a glass of wine and coca cola. Right away we ordered the Beef Wellington because we knew it was going to take 40+ minutes. The presentation of it was amazing. A beautiful golden lattice pastry. The server was nice enough to let us take a photo of it before cutting it into 2 pieces and leaving the ends on an extra plate. The best part was the sauce or gravy that it came with. It really enhanced the flavor and made the dish richer. Beef Tenderloin was cooked to perfection and all the flavors meshed well together. Very great meal and money well spent. The bartender servers were great as well, friendly people."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,Press for Champagne‚Ä¶how can one go wrong?! This lively spot is only made better by attending one of the jazz nights. Caviar service is reasonably priced and delicious and the pies are a modern twist on a British classic. Perfect opportunity to step back into days of dining gone by‚Ä¶which we should certainly bring back!
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We dined here for a joint 30th birthday celebration. As it was a special occasion we wanted an elegant and up market venue and this did not disappoint! The press for champagne buttons are great little detail and makes the dinning experience fun. The staff are very polite and professional. Service was exceptional. Between us we tried oysters, lobster macaroni cheese, and sea beam. A beautiful & elegant restaurant for a special occasion."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"I visited Bob Bob Ricard to celebrate a friend's birthday and we enjoyed everything we ordered. If your a truffle lover, the fries and mash are a must try! The chicken kyiv was so delicious, crispy on the outside and so succulent on the inside üòç However, some dishes did lack seasoning.

The interior of this restaurant is absolutely gorgeous ‚ú®The all-booth setting creates an intimate and sophisticated atmosphere. We did notice that the service was slow at times and it took a while for our food to arrive. Despite this, the unique 'Press for Champagne' button adds a fun element, making it a memorable spot for special occasions."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Top notch service and vibes. The food however has more potential, especially for that price.
Beef wellington was lacking some taste and didn‚Äôt do anything special. Service was amazing!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Absolutely worth every penny, we spent the champagne button at the table was very whimsical and does work. The service from the receptionist to the server was off the chain. The food was incredible. The Ch√¢teaubriand was amazing. Ty had the best time ever and he absolutely loved it."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"My partner has been dying to try beef wellington since I've known her, well her wish came true.

On the night we went here we'd been in London for 2 days and not impressed at all with the services of restaurants.  From breakfast places, to lunch to dinner...all were very slow to acknowledge us, bring us at least water, etc.  Maybe its a British thing but not at Bob Bob Ricard Soho!

Immediately greeted, taken to our table and then our waitress showed up in about 2 seconds, provided water and then we hit the Champagne button, and someone came within seconds.  Amazing!!!!

At this point the food could have been horrible and I would still have been happy.  But the food was amazing.  That Beef Wellington was cooked a perfect medium rare and the meat quality...OMG!  I could have eaten two of them.

The cream spinach was that perfect blend of creamy and spice, just goes so well with steak.

The steak tartare was perfect as well. Just the right amount of capers, onions and spices, loved it!

Caviar, we had the trio, highly recommended, its a nice blend of 3 different ones, well worth it.

Highly recommend reservations or you're probably not getting in.

Would I go here again?  OH HELL YAH!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Came here to celebrate an anniversary and had a wonderful experience. The atmosphere was lovely, it‚Äôs a gorgeous restaurant with a perfect setting for celebrations as a couple or with family/friends. Every item we tried from starter to dessert was of very high quality, but of course the beef wellington was the star - brilliantly prepared with wonderful flavours, tender and cooked to perfection, it is not to be missed. We returned again for a dinner with friends and the wellington and steaks were just as good as the first time, plus they provided a complementary birthday cake!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The place is stunning. Sparkling clean, is very organised and food came in time. The food is well presented. Despite not booking my dinner at the bar I had the lovely surprise because I made a new friend there. They have a nice menu with a great variety of options. The staff is very polite but could be better trained, you just need to satisfy your client. If the glass is not appropriate just swap to another one and not discuss in front of your client. Small details that could improve. I hope next time I can make clear through their website I want a normal table."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,We come here for the Instagrammable aspect and the famous ‚Äúpress for champagne‚Äù button. We will come back for the excellent food and the impeccable service.
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,We had a great holiday dinner at Bob Bob Ricard as I‚Äôm a sucker whenever beef Wellington is on a menu. Very friendly greeting and loved the all booth dining room.  Waiter helped us narrow down our wine choice and the food was outstanding. We had the caviar and tuna tartare followed by beef Wellington and mashed potatoes. Very fun evening.
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Enjoyed an early Saturday lunch. The restaurant was quiet, and we enjoyed the peace before the service got busier at standard lunch times. We enjoyed their most excellent beef Wellington, which really does live up to its reputation. There is attention paid to everything including decor, ambience, service, food, and the drink. Our server/waiter Alexandra was an excellent host, who made us feel very welcome and comfortable, but never in a fussy, or intrusive manner. The sticky toffee pudding is worth a try."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"First time here and had a fabulous time. Food was great, wine list good and well...the champagne button was a treat"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"I had the theatre menu on a Saturday afternoon, two course lunch deal for approximately ¬£30, great deal. Nice staff for lovely decor and famous press for champagne button was fun to use."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Expensive but excellent quality food, service and setting. A lovely evening meal to make you feel like you‚Äôre in the great Gatsby. If you prepared to spend over ¬£100 per person then you‚Äôll enjoy your evening without worrying about the cost. The cocktails are sublime especially with the champagne foam, and the champagne is perfectly chilled. A main each, side to share, and a dessert each was a good quantity of food for the evening."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We celebrated my birthday here, and it was an amazing and unforgettable night. The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff took exceptional care of us throughout the evening. The ambiance was stunning, making the experience even more special. We can‚Äôt wait to come back soon!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Try once..concept is cool for sure.

Caviar was good, the champagne and truffle pie too plain. Fish excellent.

Fancy place and nice booths.

Go to impress someone and have privacy of chat in the booth table as service is exceptional.

Clearly some VIPs in there and don't be shy to press the champagne button!

I would definitely go again but perhaps more for canap√©s, caviar and starters with drinks rather than a dinner.

Do dress nicely!!!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Our experience at Bob Bob Richard was truly memorable! The ambiance was cool and romantic, with gold and green decorations accented by hints of pink, setting the perfect mood for our evening. The standout was definitely the Strawberry Peach Bellini ‚Äì it was divine and I still find myself thinking about it! The creamy texture and perfect combination of strawberry and peach made it an unforgettable drink. As for the savory dishes, they were all delightful and expertly prepared. However, we would recommend skipping the bread and the signature dessert, as they were not particularly special. Nonetheless, we're eager to return and explore more of their dessert offerings next time, as we were too full to indulge further this time around. Overall, Bob Bob Richard is a must-visit for those seeking a romantic ambiance and delicious savory dishes!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Came here on a bad day, left feeling a whole lot better.
There‚Äôs something about warm food and quiet service that lifts your mood.
They didn‚Äôt try too hard, and that‚Äôs what made the experience feel real.
My order came just as I asked ‚Äî no surprises, no mistakes.
The seasoning was subtle but thoughtful, not overly salty or oily.
I noticed how the staff checked in quietly without being intrusive.
It‚Äôs now my comfort spot when I just want peace and good food."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,3.0,"Wellington in the states is better, straight up. You know it bad when the sides outshine the main food. Meat was just not seasoned at all! Only thing good was the caviar and wine. You can skip this place"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"So, famous Bob Bob Ricard. Just love this place and the food there‚ù§Ô∏è Been many times and never disappointed. The service is amazing, the design is beautiful and the food just very tasty.
They have very cozy tables, which are located in such a way that you are kind of separated from everyone. Press for champagne always works üòÖ
Would recommend to try their vareniki, with truffle and hake, that is so delicious."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"This is a lovely restaurant with service that means the ""press for more champagne"" button isn't actually needed. We were seated at the bar which was great fun. The food was really good and the cocktails even better! We arrived a little early and they accommodated us straight away. I would happily return."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Very good food, no option for any kind of fresh salad on the menu though. Very polite service, beautiful atmosphere. Should visit when in London, preferably during no busy hours because it geta a bit loud."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,1.0,"Absolutely terrible. Bumping this to ensure nobody makes the brutal mistake of eating here.

I have never had an experience this disgustingly bad. If I could sum up this restaurant it is pure instagram hype with zero substance.

The beef wellington is the supposed crown jewel of this establishment and it far missed the mark. Raw dough, poor beef quality and overpowering duxelle. Unbelievable a restaurant charging ¬£98 pound for a signature dish could serve raw dough.

The salmon en croute was similarly awful, boasting a fishy flavour due to old salmon.

The service was extremely disappointing, requiring multiple reminders to refill the glass. When asked about the Praline (nut allergy at the table) the waiter was incapable of clarifying what kind of nuts before eventually coming to the realisation that perhaps he should check with the kitchen. Despite multiple complaints. No attempt to offer even an apology. Just an empty promise to deliver the feedback to the kitchen.

The desserts were the perfect summary of the experience. Dry toffee pudding. A creme brulee that tasted of fish. I cannot fathom the absolute lack of care to be able to contaminate creme brulee with fish flavour.

The one and only gimmick of this restaurant which brings patrons to the venue is their champagne button.

If you are serious in any way about food that tastes good and service that is attentive and focused, do not dine here. It is for those who care only about posting on their social media that they eat at expensive restaurants. A Nusret experience."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"My new favorite place in London!

Gorgeous British restaurant situated in the heart of SoHo serving traditional dishes, and some old world/ Russian specialities. Chilled vodka, caviar, eggs. A million other options.

Went there especially to try the beef Wellington. It was outstanding! A number of starters also available, including oysters. Food is top notch!

Impressive wine list, including a long list of very good champagnes. Cocktails also available. The French 75 was excellent.

The interior is a gorgeous and unique art deco setting. You can‚Äôt help feeling special. Service is excellent. Helpful, charming, attentive.

Top marks! Will make this a regular place. Don‚Äôt miss out!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Wonderful lunch at Bob Bob Ricard. Excellent friendly service. Really good choice  on the menu with vegan/vegetarian options of dishes that aren‚Äôt necessarily listed as Vegan.
Lots of virgin versions of cocktails which is lovely. Had a very foamy peach and strawberry Bellini."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"My first time visiting after hearing much about Bob Bob Ricard, and I was not disappointed. I was expecting an eye watering bill, but it‚Äôs actually very easy to drink and eat extremely well here for under ¬£70 a head. Naturally, we pressed for champagne and ordered a bottle, and for the none champagne drinkers there‚Äôs a good selection of wines and cocktails. The pies were delicious, and beef Wellington divine. Will definitely be returning."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The Champagne button in the booth drew us in!
The ambiance was wonderful, with suitably attentive service by staff that seemed to care that you were having a good time.
We enjoyed the food, which was great quality and very tasty. We tried 4 different champagnes by the glass, courtesy of ‚Äúthe button‚Äù!
We will definitely be going back and taking another couple with us"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Went for the award winning beef wellington, it was really melt in your mouth beef with a good gravy to accompany, they give you a second helping on the side. It can only be ordered for two, perfect for 4 of us. Recommend to pair with spinach and fries or mash. The mood is nice and seems quite private for each table. The lighting is dim, perfect for intimate conversations. Great service up until our actual ordering, the server seemed a little moody, the rest of team were really nice to us, maybe a bad day. We went 14th December, around 5pm. Either way ignoring that, it was still good."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,1.0,"We live in Bloomsbury and we‚Äôre excited to spend our 10 year anniversary here. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. No sommelier, no attention to service, basically diner level service with Michelin starred pricing.

While Bob Bob Ricard might have had a moment in the late naughtys‚Ä¶ that moment has passed. Save your style, grace and hard earned money and go somewhere with good
Food.

This is an Instagram ‚Äúclick here for champagne‚Äù that should have been done away with years ago. Shame of you Bob Bob
Ricard.

0/5

Blah Blah Ricard."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The restaurant offered an exceptional dining experience in every aspect. From the moment you step in, the ambiance exudes class, creating an inviting atmosphere that sets the stage for an elevated culinary journey. I strongly advise making a reservation to fully immerse yourself in the fine dining experience that this establishment has to offer.

During my visit, I opted for the sea bream, and I was delighted to find that it was prepared with exquisite precision, showcasing the chef's mastery in the art of cooking. Equally impressive was my wife's choice of the Chateaubriand, which met and exceeded her expectations.

The crowning glory of our meal was the dessert‚Äîa delightful creation that not only satisfied the sweet tooth but left a lasting impression. As evident from the culinary craftsmanship, it's clear that the chef pays meticulous attention to detail.

My overall experience was so memorable that I eagerly anticipate returning for future visits. This restaurant has truly mastered the essence of fine dining, making it a must-try for anyone seeking an upscale culinary adventure."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Very good service, food was excellent and a good choice of champagne available. Will be returning"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Fine dishes and good services. I booked for a 3:30pm table on 19/10/2024 and was late to turn up at the restaurant. The receptionist lady originally could not arrange a table until late at night. However, her boss (photo attached) could manage the booking and took the initiative to help and reserve me a table at 5pm. I would express my appreciation for his kindness publicly. üôèüôèüôè"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Absolutely loved it. We celebrated my mother‚Äôs birthday here and it turned out amazing. Great service, delicious food and ambiance. Would recommend"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"The dishes were slightly lacking salt, but they remained very good. I am also unsure how house-made the pur√©e is: the texture was off.
Despite this, the meal was very enjoyable. Absolutely loved the button ""press for champagne"" next to the table."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"As we were celebrating on a Tuesday, the restaurant was a bit empty. Luckily I was offered a tour of the restaurant which I find fabulous. The decor is artsy and breathtaking and really feels like you are in the Orient Express.

We really loved the full experience and the food was amazing. They have caviar and oysters with a great wine list plus Vintage armagnac.

Once at your table you will for sure get the urge to press the champagne button which I found cool and funny.

This is a very nice place for a special occasion or to celebrate a special event since they have huge closed private rooms.

Thanks again for the great experience. :)"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Classic restaurant. Came for the ""press for champagne"" fun, and did not disappoint. Had oyster for starters, lobster Mac n cheese, and chicken & champagne pie with creme brulee to top it off.  Had a really fun date night"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Had a simply wonderful birthday party in the private room. The food was quite outstanding, the lemon sole possibly the best fish that I have eaten, the service was faultless and the staff delightful. Our guests were great too! Thank you."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Simply fabulous place. While the food was delicious, their drinks menu is very impressive too.
Their chilled Vodka is divine.
Other notable dishes were, beef Wellington, lobster Mac & Cheese."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Our dining experience at BBR Soho was phenomenal. I enjoyed the cocktails as we shared bread, salads and the Beef Wellington. The oysters were prepared perfectly and it took me back to a childhood moment in the coast of Florida. Our celebration cake surprised my date and created a magical moment in the downstairs dining room. The elegance of the atmosphere truly enhanced our time together. Staff did everything they could to ensure the process was what the owner intended to happen. A peaceful retreat to enjoy traditional foods. What I appreciate most is the accuracy of it all. Never did I feel staff waived once to attend to requests or seem confused, given we are Americans with wild accents. We are pleased guests, already excited about our next meal at BBR! Well done! Applause for the staff and a kiss for the chefs!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Bob Bob Ricard is probably one of the best gourmet restaurants in London. Whilst it's still an expensive and posh place, it's very cozy and the atmosphere is very warm and welcoming, nothing like other similar places in Mayfair and central London.

I am not a huge fan of this type of restaurant normally but this one surprised me positively!

The food is excellent, everything we've had, from the starters to dessert was top notch and the portion sizes were decent for this type of restaurant. The staff very very courteous and friendly and even though it was a Saturday they didn't rush us out when we finished our meal and paid.

I will definitely go back and highly recommend the place. It's perfect for any occasion, whether you are a bigger group or on a date - it's ideal. There is also a funky seating area downstairs."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Really beautiful, cozy atmosphere. You are seated in a booth and each booth has a button for you to request champagne which is a nice touch. Service was impeccable. There was a slight error with part of our order, and it was fixed immediately. We had the caviar tasting with the frozen vodka shots. I‚Äôm not a huge vodka fan, but it was nice and the caviar, blini and creme fraiche were delightful.  Next we tried the seafood pelmini which was lovely.  We shared a small beef wellington which was perfectly cooked and one of the best wellingtons I have had here in London.  Sides were tasty as well.  Really enjoyed the truffle mashed potatoes and green beans. Champagne cocktails were great‚Äî especially the champagne foam on top.  We tried the Bellini and one that was more like a mojito. We also had the rose moet which was very nice. We had truffles for dessert because we were so full at that point, but the larger desserts sounded very tempting. The truffles were a perfect sweet ending without being too filling."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"When making the booking, I noted that the dinner was for a special occasion ‚Äì a birthday. However, we were seated at one of the least desirable tables in the restaurant, and the birthday cake was brought out late.
While the restaurant setting and service were very pleasant, I was disappointed that no special effort appeared to have been made to acknowledge the occasion or enhance the overall experience.
The food was delicious."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,We went here for the Phoenician themed cocktails! Everything was exactly like it was in the movie and it was a great experience. The staff was amazing and in full character and it was just a fun night!
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,2.0,"Last weekend I was very disappointed at my visit to Bob Bob Ricard.

The food was okay, not bad but not great. For the price you pay you can visit so many other great restaurants in Soho and London more broadly.  Sides are not included so you must order some to go with your main.

The champagne list was disappointing. It was exciting to press the button and the service was great. The wait staff agreed to not top up our glasses so we could press button every time we wanted them to top us up. They came instantly and it was great novelty.

In general this place is for Instagram. The score reflects the perception vs the reality in experience. It‚Äôs novelty. For the price I paid, you could have a better experience somewhere else."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"This was our second visit to BBR soho (we have also visited BBR city & Bebe Bob) and it was just as enjoyable as the first.

From the moment you walk through the door the experience starts- the decor is amazing and sitting in a booth it feels incredibly private but there‚Äôs still a buzz in the air creating the perfect ambiance.

On every BBR we order the trio of caviar to share with our pre dinner drink as it is so delicious and also good value.

We then had a starter & main then shared a dessert-All of the food was very enjoyable.
We love the menu as it‚Äôs simple comfort food with a luxurious twist executed perfectly.

The service is discreet and champagne is topped up without me even noticing!

Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Following a friend's enthusiastic recommendation, we dined at Bob Bob Ricard and were utterly delighted. The impeccable service began at the door with a warm coat check.
We were escorted to our table in the beautifully low-lit and elegantly decorated dining room. A delightful touch: every table is equipped with a dedicated champagne button! As champagne aficionados, we were thrilled.
We commenced with glasses of Louis Roederer Brut and their Ros√©. For our appetizer, we shared the exquisite lobster dumplings. For the main course, we indulged in Beef Wellington accompanied by creamy mashed potatoes and tender spinach, all expertly paired with a 2009 Margaux. Our server informed us that the restaurant maintains a reasonable 75% markup on wines, allowing guests to explore exceptional vintages that might otherwise be prohibitively expensive (typical markups often exceed 300%).
To conclude, we savored a dramatic presentation of flaming cr√®me br√ªl√©e, paired with a renowned Sauternes and a South African wine.
From the moment we arrived at the final bite, Bob Bob Ricard was an unforgettable culinary experience. A must-visit for any discerning foodie."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We had an amazing dining experience, the staff were incredibly attentive. The food was absolutely fantastic, so delicious. We will definitely be coming again!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"A very fun place for a special occasion. The ""press for champagne"" button works as advertised! Excellent, attentive service. Quiet, classy atmosphere. The food was also very good, although our options were limited as one of us has a prawn allergy. Can't wait to go back and press the button again!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The food was amazing. I definitely recommend the beef wellington, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. The desserts looked great and tasted great! The staff were the right amount of attentive, and the best part is that at the table there is a button to press for more champagne."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"This restaurant is housed in a charming venue steeped in history. The service here is top-notch, with attentive staff who make you feel truly welcome. Additionally, they offer an impressive selection of champagnes at very reasonable prices."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,Had the most amazing lunch. Beef wellington was something special and I would definitely go back and order it again. Also i had the oyster and caviar for starter
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"It was an amazing dinner. They took care of every detail and the recommendations from our waiter (Manuel) were so good. The quality of food is great. We will come back again, for sure."
St. John,5.0,"This is unpretentious excellence. In a world where TikTok hype drives crowds, St. John just focuses on doing things right (boring done right).

It is a classic British spot, known for its nose-to-tail approach. Service was polite and professional without being fussy. We never felt rushed and never felt ignored.

The fish of the day was excellent, and of course we had the bone marrow on toast, which was worth the visit on its own. Flavours are not experimental, but the quality and freshness make everything great. I had the pigeon, which I really enjoyed, although the meat is firmer and the flavour stronger than other meats, so it may not be for everyone.

Right outside is a more casual bar with a lighter atmosphere where you can have a drink and snack on excellent food without spending much."
St. John,5.0,"Perfect for people who want good cooking with adventurous options! Got a drink at the bar as I arrived a little early, house wine was great. Our waitress was wonderful, and spent extra time recommending dishes for us. I got the Pig and Ox Liver, both of which were amazing. The madeleines cannot be missed, I would go for them over a regular dessert. Easy recommendation, get a reservation early!"
St. John,5.0,"This is by far the best British restaurant I‚Äôve ever had in my whole life. I‚Äôve come to UK for two weeks and nothing of what I‚Äôve tried so far can be compared to this restaurant. From the starters, to the mains, to the desserts. It‚Äôs just ‚Äúmmm‚Äù ü•∞üòò. So good, so delicious!

Glad that I came here during my time in the UK. Would love to pay this place a visit again üôè"
St. John,5.0,"What a special restaurant! Really enjoyed the inventive British menu, every dish was unique and thoughtful, without being pretentious. Fun to try some more unusual cuts of meat. Great drinks list and the bread pudding dessert was incredible. Service was extremely thoughtful and attentive, and helpful with dietaries. Wonderful experience and I look forward to our next visit!"
St. John,5.0,"St. John Smithfield was an absolutely wonderful and totally unique experience that totally lived up to expectations.
The food was excellent and very unique. We had the Hake and Ox Liver for our mains, the Bone Marrow for our appetizer, and Plum Tart (not quite sure if that‚Äôs the name) for dessert. Most of these you would struggle to find elsewhere but was nevertheless brilliant.
The service was unpretentious and attentive. No complaints other than maybe a very slight ‚Äúcoldness‚Äù.
The atmosphere was difficult to rate because it really doesn‚Äôt have much going for it. It‚Äôs rustic yet very simplistic and really doesn‚Äôt distract from the food, which I appreciate.
In conclusion, St. John was an excellent restaurant that certainly lives up to the hype and I can understand why it was supposedly Anthony Bourdain‚Äôs favorite restaurant in London."
St. John,5.0,"Very much enjoyed this visit.   The room had a great vibe.  The service is very friendly, and the food was fantastic.   We had a large group and had almost one of everything and it was all good.  Some weird stuff like chicken neck and lamb liver but all of was excellent.   The smell and taste of the fresh Madeleines at the end were simply awesome.  I will be back on future London visits."
St. John,5.0,"Attentive service.  Food was great.  Bone marrow tasted great but very little substance.  The butter was nice.  Madeleines was perfect.

Ambience a bit plain and run down.  Feels not so clean."
St. John,5.0,"This restaurant is truly one of a kind ‚Äî the atmosphere, the setting, and the character make it stand out. The quality of the food is consistently outstanding. Special mention to the bone marrow, which has remained unchanged over time, and to the impeccable, almost clinical-level service we‚Äôve received on each visit.
We‚Äôll keep coming back on every future trip to London.

Can‚Äôt wait to return and end another joyful meal with the best madeleines in the UK!"
St. John,2.0,"We stopped here for lunch while exploring England, drawn in by the restaurant‚Äôs strong reputation. Our group ordered a wide range of dishes‚Äîfrom tripe to a simple roast chicken‚Äîbut unfortunately, none of them left much of an impression. My roast chicken, in particular, was disappointing: moist but bland, and honestly not as good as what my mom makes at home. Surprisingly, the appetizers were more enjoyable than the mains, which helped salvage the experience a bit. Overall, we left feeling underwhelmed and less enthusiastic about exploring British cuisine‚Äîunless it‚Äôs the classic fish and chips."
St. John,5.0,"I recently shot the reception of a lovely wedding at St John. It was incredible! What a wonderful venue, amazing staff and the food was next level. Can thoroughly recommend to any couple looking for the right venue in London, St John is the one."
St. John,5.0,"First time visit at the ‚ÄúOG‚Äù st.johns at smithfield. Everything went smoothly and we had an amazing time - From the atmosphere, to the service and the incredible food. You can sense how well the whole concept is planned and that the passion translates onto the plates. All the dishes that we ordered delivered, especially the duck and roast bone marrow were amazing. Local produce never fails to disappoint. Will definitely come again as they do change menu items frequently."
St. John,5.0,"Love this place. I‚Äôd advise sitting in the bar and ordering small plates. Restaurant also brilliant but I love a low key relaxed vibe. Menu changes daily but loads of great, interesting options."
St. John,5.0,"I was recommended St John‚Äôs, and it absolutely lived up to expectations. The space is interesting, with the bar area set in what looks like an old smokehouse, adding a bit of character. The restaurant itself is clean, white, and minimal, with a rustic touch that ties everything together. It‚Äôs simple but works well.

One of the standout features is the in-house bakery, which seems to handle all the desserts, and they do an incredible job.

The service was excellent. My server Callum was fantastic‚Äîfriendly, helpful with the menu, and went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect. He even spoke to head chef John, who then came out for a chat, which was a really nice surprise and made the night even more special.

The food itself was outstanding. Every dish was top quality, perfectly executed, and full of flavor. It‚Äôs clear why St John‚Äôs has a Michelin star and has kept it.

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for incredible food in a relaxed and unpretentious setting. It‚Äôs well worth a visit!"
St. John,5.0,"I was there for an invited dinner through a scientific event. The food was excellent and my options were all vegan. We had very good wine and food overall and the service and staff were friendly, fast, and particularly welcoming. Of course the atmosphere is very nice considering the old grounds and the nice architecture."
St. John,3.0,"Service was great and it was good to experience some authentic style British cooking. Unfortunately the food was not as good as expected for the price and hype. There wasn't much to eat in the bone marrow and half of the lamb was just fat. At best bib gourmand, no way this place is Michelin 1 star."
St. John,5.0,"Absolutely stunning restaurant! I was here recently and had some of the most fantastic food.

Firstly we were pleasantly greeted by a lovely gentleman (didn‚Äôt catch his name but he was super chatty and lovely). And we were seated right by the kitchen which was perfect! Loved seeing the chefs work, one of them was butchering a whole pig at one point - incredible!

The food was an easy 10/10. The bone marrow was easily the best dish we had, it‚Äôs obvious why they run out of this so quickly. The pork head and broth was so rich and delicious and we loved the lamb and the blood cake too. And how could I forget the Welsh rarebit. So rich and delicious. I want this again! And I‚Äôd go back just to have the bone marrow again and again.

Highly recommended."
St. John,5.0,Amazing spot. Food was awesome and the staff was Very kind. They even got us the bread on a take away box cause ouro baby loved It.
St. John,5.0,"Hands down this was a top 3 food experience of our life. The food was simply delicious and this is what matters in the end. Big thumbs up to Anthony, the aussie waiter who took care of us."
St. John,4.0,"In a room of white so still,
Where linens drape and time stands still,
Plates arrive, a work of art,
Each a feast, a perfect start.

The menu shifts with each new day,
Check ahead, don‚Äôt lose your way.
The staff will guide if you‚Äôre unsure,
A dining haven, calm and pure.

For six we booked, a lucky find,
Weeks ahead, the stars aligned.
Crab and herring, bright and bold,
Flavors fresh and stories told.

Gurnard, golden, placed with care,
Pork cheek rich beyond compare.
Greens and potatoes on the side,
Simple joys that none denied.

Then dessert‚Äîa final cheer,
Honeycomb and sponge appear.
Sticky, sweet, and deeply spun,
Every bite a perfect one.

Steep the price, but worth it all,
A meal to hold, a night to call.
For here, the food alone will shine,
A masterpiece in every line."
St. John,5.0,It's a vibe. Not fine dining but gives you the sense that you're about to witness something special. People in regular clothes going but having a delicious and well crafted meal
St. John,3.0,"A disappointing visit to what had been one of our favorite restaurants. The quality of the food at St. John has always been the foundation of our love for the institution, but it feels as though there isn‚Äôt the same care for the preparation as there has been in the past. The bone marrow was remarkably dry. The other dishes lacked any flavor. The only saving graces were the Welsh rarebit and the lemon tart."
St. John,2.0,"Incredibly underwhelming place.

The food is decent, and actually tastes quite alright if you don't go for crazy options, but the dining room felt very uncomfortable for me. It is trying to be rustic and authentic, but just looks bad. It was loud, the constant buzzing of (I guess) old fluorescent lightbulbs was getting on my nerves, I got shouted at by a server when I accidentally stumbled to the entrance of the room instead of a polite ""Excuse me"".

I have been to a lot of restaurants in London, from Delaunay and Fazenda to various pubs and kebab shops, and this is the most uncomfortable I have ever felt, with the least appetizing food ever.

If you want British food, skip this place, go to a pub, and then somewhere for the afternoon tea for the price of dining here.

The desserts were lovely though, and tasted great, but it's not saving the overall experience."
St. John,2.0,Can only edit to update for this year's experience.  Unfortunately was nothing like our first visit last year.  The quality of the food was down considerably and service less attentive.  Definitely a disappointing visit and unlikely to come again the next time we are in London
St. John,5.0,"I enjoyed our meal at St. John. We ordered the squid, fennel and aioli and brown crab meat for starters and they were lovely. We had the trotter pie for our main to share. It was nice and very filling. We also had the welsh rarebit to come with our main, but it was a bit disappointing since the bread was a bit burned and hard."
St. John,5.0,Great experience .. incredible and interesting take on their dishes.   Impecable service !! Lots of Fun and super good food
St. John,5.0,"I'm giving this 5 stars overall as the experience and concept were bit spot on. Great service, flexible when we decided to eat further mains and knowledgeable when it came to drinks. The food was not very precisely cooked/prepared (liver over, bacon dry without being crispy ,mussel salad watery) but they were quite busy. Overall 100% recommended. Treat yourself to the Madeline's - ethereal üòç"
St. John,5.0,"The restaurant of my dreams. Had wanted to go for ages with my partner and our visit did not disappoint in the slightest.

Staff were friendly and attentive, without being overbearing and really made us feel at ease. There is an old school charm to proceedings, without ever feeling stuffy or exclusionary.

The atmosphere is relaxed, and the light, airy dining room cultivates a lovely buzz.

The food was everything I'd hoped for. Rustic, traditional, comforting and incredibly satisfying. Our favourite dishes were the smoked cod's roe, sweetbreads, and the Eccles cake, but everything was done masterfully. Even a simple bowl of spring greens tossed in butter and a little bit of broth were a delight. Please be aware, this is not for the tweezers and foam crew; it is nose to tail cooking, with the focus being on the ingredients, not avant garde presentation.

All in all, a fantastic lunch and I can't wait to return"
St. John,5.0,We enjoyed a relaxed and very tasty Monday lunch at the end of a long weekend in town. We've been here before and the constantly changing menu didn't disappoint. Attentive service in a busy dining area that was arranged to provide atmosphere without overcrowding.
St. John,5.0,"One of my favourite restaurants in the world and one of the best arguments for British food I've ever experienced. The staff were incredible, the perfect balance of attentiveness and leaving you to enjoy your food and company. They also advise on how much we should order (they actually suggested that we ordered too many side dishes) as well as wines to pair well with different dishes.

The food itself was, as you would expect, exceptional. The famous Bone Marrow exceeded the hype, we had Pigeon and Sole which were beautifully cooked with the perfect accompaniments. This place has made me wish Welsh Rarebit was available as a side in every restaurant. The meal overall was very good value for money considering the amount and quality of what we ate.

Absolutely looking forward to going back at the soonest opportunity."
St. John,5.0,"I really enjoyed here- it was a lovely dinner.

Gluten free chocolate cake is a must if you ask me. Roasted bone marrow was good but I would try other items on my next visit.

There were a couple of highlights. The wine with honey and almond flavor - the gluten free chocolate cake and the lamb dish (it was rich but super tasty)."
St. John,4.0,"Went for a Wednesday night dinner and service was amazing! Our waiter was very friendly

The bone marrow & sardines were delicious - but the braised beef was slightly too chewy for my liking. The rest of the food was ok. Pavlova for dessert was the best!"
St. John,3.0,"The food was simply sad looking. I do acknowledge St John‚Äôs impact on the fine dining world, but the food was just not‚Ä¶ hitting. The flavours and textures were very understated and frankly, not great. We paid ¬£28 for a crab dish that we had to deshell ourselves and we barely got any meat out of it. We also spotted a mouse on the way to the toilets. Not worth the hype in my opinion. Thankfully, the meal was fairly cheap."
St. John,5.0,"Coffee, Gurnard, bread, mussels and ginger cake are all good, also the service was good as well."
St. John,5.0,"Came for lunch on a Friday, the restaurant and bar area were both busy.

The food was excellent, with the standouts being the bone marrow starter and honeycomb ice cream for dessert.

The service was friendly without being overbearing. Prices were reasonable given the quality of food

Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
St. John,5.0,"Fantastic meal and exceptional service from a London institution. Quality British fare at its finest - great ingredients and smart twists on dishes classic and modern.
Rustic settings and attentive wait staff. Massive wine & drinks list as well to complement the food."
St. John,5.0,"I would recommend coming here. The service and food are great. I had the venison broth and (special) hare saddle which were both fantastic. Is very difficult to get reservations here, and I can see why."
St. John,5.0,"Absolutely wonderful, one of the best meals I have ever had with lovely staff who were very helpful and clearly very passionate about the food.

We went for lunch and found the place to be very unpretentious, it's a place where they let the food shine and stand on the quality of the food.

It was an open kitchen and getting to watch the chef was really fantastic.

Our group of three had three different dishes, one beef, one with pigs cheek and one with pork belly and trotters, all of them were just wonderful.

The green salad as a side was incredibly simple but somehow had such an amazing depth of flavour and the Welsh rarebit was unreal.

The dessert menu is very extensive and the date loaf with butterscotch sauce was the best dessert my Mum has ever had while the Madeleines were absolutely incredible, so simple but so good.

I also thought for the equality of the food and service the price was very reasonable for a special meal."
St. John,3.0,"While we enjoyed going out for dinner, this restaurant sadly is not worth it for the price you pay in our opinion. We were disappointed firstly with the presentation of the food, very little thought gone in when you are spending ¬£15 - ¬£30 a plate. Across all dishes we found them either to be too salty or sweet and the sauce with the rabbit was watery and lacking in flavour. All in all the balance was off in all dishes in our opinion and for what you are spending you get far better elsewhere. On the plus side our waiter was lovely, and the venue while not to our taste was unique, but sadly we won‚Äôt be rushing back."
St. John,4.0,"I was lucky enough to get a last-minute booking for their 30th anniversary menu. This restaurant had been on my radar for several years but it was the promotion that finally made try it.

I had the famous bone marrow but I have had better bone marrow elsewhere. In my opinion the green salad with parsley, capers and dressing overpowers the flavour of the bone marrow, and it should be served with something else.

I ordered two mains, the skate with tomato and aioli and a lamb chop that replaced the roast Mangalitza that they ran out of. I was served both mains at once, which made me a bit stressed about food getting cold. I would have preferred having those served staggered and I am guessing service did not warn the kitchen.

The skate was very well cooked and balanced and the combination with the juicy tomatoes and aioli worked perfectly. The lamb roast on the other hand was lukewarm and although it was tasty and tender it was not as interesting.

For dessert I ordered the lemon posset and the Eccle Cake with Lancashire cheese. I was indifferent to the former, and pleasantly surprised with the latter. The pairing with the cheese works really well and I enjoyed it a lot. I ordered 6 madeleines to go that came right out of the oven, which is something I really appreciated and should be encouraged in bakeries.

Other than the fault with the main dishes the service was very attentive and kind. The ambiance of the place is relaxed and also formal, which I really loved.

St. John is a staple in London and it is a must-try. The anniversary promotion made the meal more special and enjoyable , but I am not sure I would have been so happy to pay the full price for all those dishes which could have easily been over ¬£100. However, overall I really liked the variety and quality of their menu and I will definitely come back."
St. John,5.0,"I had high expectations and somehow they were exceeded. I think about the bone-marrow and sardines daily - they were incredible. The weakest part of the dish was the Welsh rarebit - I found it flat. Despite the lamb being very good, I felt something was missing. However, the Ox heart and chicory was delicious and opened me to how good heart can be when cooked very well. If you are going to get any desert - get the blood orange cake. I don‚Äôt like sugary things  - but it was the best cake I have ever had. Perfect balance of sweet and tart."
St. John,5.0,"Wow ü§Ø if you haven‚Äôt been to St. John‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ what are you doing??!?! I can‚Äôt believe this was my first time here and my 1000th time in London, I will definitely be making this a regular. Was quite easy to get an early reservation for lunch. Really enjoyed the concept and overall food experience. The servers were so knowledgeable and are really proud of the animal sources and overall restaurant 10/10."
St. John,5.0,"The legend lives on. Delicious food in a stripped down, no fuss no frills kind of place that becomes almost charming because of the great food and staff. It's not a usual occasion nor sight, to walk in and find a world renowned chef sitting at a table dining with friends. If this happens 9 out of 10 times you know you're in for a treat. And it was, my only regret is not to have shown up starving so I could try more items. If I have one complaint it would be the stemware, although charming and quirky, the wine list has some gems and I feel like they deserve some elevated glassware, but then again it adds to the charm and ethos of the no fuss no frills experience, its all about enjoying and sharing great food with great people."
St. John,5.0,"This is one of the must-try restaurants in London. The restaurant can be described as: ""no fuss, just a properly cooked food"".

Their menu always changes, with dishes constantly on rotation, and the only thing that stays consistent is Quality. Everything we had was on a different scale of ""good"". From simple ""that's good"" to ""this is the best meal I've had in a while""

Cannot recommend this place enough, either for dinner or lunch.

The only downside - the reception in the restaurant is quite poor, so you may need to get in and out if you need access to the internet."
St. John,5.0,"Visited in May during a quick London getaway.
Everything was phenomenal.
I understand they change the menu seasonally so I won‚Äôt list what I had.

They take pride in their culinary art and it definitely shows.
We took the last dinner reservation yet staff were patient with us"
St. John,5.0,Travelled from Thailand to this legendary establishment in 2022. I'm a big fan of Anthony Bourdain's No reservation and this place is on my bucket list. The staffs were lovely and the food was execptional. Simple yet elegance no frills British cuisine. Highly recommended.
St. John,5.0,"Second visit this year and it was as good as the first time.  I'd pass on the famous bone marrow starter next time - it's hit and miss as to whether you actually get any marrow but what you do get is delicious.  The potted beef was as great as I remember it.
Pheasant and Trotter pie was excellent as was the Hake and the Welsh Rarebit.  All washed down with a bottle of St John Macon. Finished with fresh madeleines and a Fergroni.  If you're used to overly attentive service then dont expect that here.  The service is good but a few more smiles would not go amiss.  We'll be back next time we're in London."
St. John,1.0,"My horrible experience at this restaurant has prompted to write my first google review. It baffles me that an establishment like this has a Michelin star as well as relatively good reviews. It‚Äôs made me question my sanity really. I was so excited to dine here because of its Michelin star rating, Anthony Bourdain‚Äôs high praise, and overall good reviews. However, I was severely disappointed. My review is due to the poor service and subpar food.

St. John has an almost all-white interior. The ambience (or lack of) feels like you're in a mental asylum and sterile.

Service: When we sat down, we were served bread and butter right away but were not provided bread plates. Our server knew of this as she saw that we had to rest our butter knives in the bread basket, yet she did nothing about it. Our server did not take the time to run us through a menu that, perhaps due to not being familiar with British cuisine, we did not know half of what was on there. Throughout the meal we were not asked if we were enjoying the meal once and it almost felt like our table was forgotten about. One experience that really tainted the experience was when one of the busy boys placed our appetizers on our table without saying a word, looked at us, and then walked away. This same bus boy was seen touching his phone and then touching the tops of the utensils he was supposed to clean. Ironically there are signs in the dining room that mention to not have your phones out.

Food: On top of the service, what truly made this experience horrible was having to pay for overpriced mediocre at best food. This part again really confuses me because everyone seems to like the food here but truly I would not pay for this food at all. We ordered the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù bone marrow and pig ear dish. The bone marrow was nothing special and the parsley ‚Äúsalad‚Äù was more like a garnish than a salad. Maybe we were served smaller bones or were just not competent in taking the bone marrow out of the bones but I don't think the bone marrow we got even amount to a tablespoon. The pig ear tasted like nothing and the salad was overdressed and way too oily.

For our entrees, we ordered the ox tail and the eel. While the oxtail was cooked nicely, you could find better mash at any non-michelin star restaurant. Overall the oxtail was not worth the price. The eel was way too salty, too small of a portion for the price, and its runner beans were watery and just basically steamed vegetables with horseradish thrown on top.

We were going to order their medeleines but the idea of waiting 15 more minutes for mediocre overpriced food at this restaurant was unbearable. Overall, the restaurant felt as if it was trying too hard and yet did not deliver on anything. Save your money and try all the other restaurants London has to offer."
St. John,4.0,Very authentic feeling British spot! The food was overall not that great in our opinion except for the bone marrow which was pretty good and the madeleins which were absolutely delicious. Service was perfect and very friendly.
St. John,5.0,"St. John was definitely a unique experience. The service was great, all of the staff were lovely and attentive. The pickled mackerel were a standout for us - unreal don‚Äôt sleep on it! If it is available get it - trust. The artichokes were also great and so was the bone marrow of course. We tried the devilled kidneys on toast - these were very rich definitely had a particular taste (we were warned they weren‚Äôt for everyone) but don‚Äôt have regrets about trying them! Only suggestion for these would be to get a side to soak up the sauce or balance the dish more. We got a side of the greens but the dressing was a bit heavy. Side note the St. John Pinot Noir was actually very good as well.

Overall it was a memorable experience and we would definitely come back!"
St. John,5.0,St John not only has some of the most reasonably priced cocktails I have had in London so far but also some of the most delicious food as well! I enjoyed their snails and John dory whilst my partner enjoyed their goats curd and tomatoes. We left feeling very satisfied with our meal and will definitely be returning.
St. John,5.0,"Outstanding food, glorious menu. Everything cooked using local, market fresh ingredients. Great wine list too. Everything is so  good, so it's difficult to single one dish. If you get the chance, go, don't hesitate."
St. John,4.0,"I can see why this was one of Bourdain's favorites (if not his favorites). Paper tablecloths, simple decor on the top of a normal bar. The atmosphere is fun, and casual and light. No pretentiousness.

Food was good, but in my humble opinion (I am not a Michelin reviewer, just a schmuck on the internet) it's not one star worthy. If I'm being extremely picky, the bread I believe was over-toasted (it was sharp to the point it was cutting into the roof of my mouth). One of my marrow bones had hardly anything in it. In addition, I believe that the Lamb's Liver was also underseasoned but that may just be my salt-crazed American pallette.

In terms of highlights, the Madelines are a must try, they are served hot and fresh and are a real treat. Also the chips with the Lamb's Liver were the best I had during my stay.

Staff was friendly and kind. They were very very busy for a Monday so I was dining for a while, but they were extremely helpful."
St. John,5.0,"My mom and I had an incredible lunch here. After hearing so many recommend St. John‚Äôs, we were very excited. Although the food was amazing, what really made the meal special was our waiter, Oz. He was kind enough to walk us through the menu, ask us about ourselves, and provided amazing service. He recommended we try the bone marrow, poached skate, welsh rarebit, crispy pig skin, and ox heart (special). I loved the bone marrow and the ox heart. The bone marrow on top the sourdough with the parsley was very rich, but also refreshing because of the parsley. The ox heart was lean, but surprisingly quite tender and full of flavor. I ate it with the horseradish that it came with and wow, what a bite (a somewhat painful one haha). For dessert, Oz recommended the ginger loaf and butterscotch sauce, and of course the madeleines. The ginger-loaf was AMAZING. It wasn‚Äôt overly sweet, and was so moist and I could eat it for every meal. I would recommend getting a cup of earl gray to drink with it. As for the madeleines, they were warm and light, and oh so delicious. We will definitely return to St. John‚Äôs on our next visit to London."
St. John,5.0,"Oh my goodness, what an amazing place! The food is exceptional - made by a team that really understands and love flavour. The service team are really knowledgeable and helpful and the atmosphere is really unusual - austere but somehow really welcoming"
St. John,5.0,"Amazing food, and service.  Marrow Bone, Pig Skin and Madelines are amazing"
St. John,5.0,"Really nice place. Very good service, somewhat casual and delicious food from the less common ingredients (tripes, bone marrow, pork skin, brain, snails etc). Strong wine selection."
St. John,4.0,"Wonderful lunch, some hits and misses but generally the food is good.

Since they are a bakery I‚Äôd have expected bread to be warm when they serve but it wasn‚Äôt.

Sauces for salad are repeat in different dishes

Must book ahead as they seem to be quite popular."
St. John,5.0,"Great and authentic English cuisine, worth every penny you spend"
St. John,5.0,"A very nice dining area with white-washed decor and professional staff. Although a bit noisy the day we went due to a large group gathering, it was difficult to hear each other while talking. Nevertheless, I liked the seating and the food options. The fish was great, simply out of this world, cooked to perfection. We also enjoyed our braised lamb, and yes, the sardines were grilled with mastery.

Will try bone marrow and ox liver some other day.

and yeah they have some good cocktails."
St. John,5.0,"We arrived on a Tuesday for lunch. It was packed but we had a reservation.
We started with some bread and butter and then moved on to the bone marrow with parsley salad. It was very good but beware: you‚Äôll spill food on your clothes! Very tasty ox tongue with beetroot and horseradish. We also had the grilled lamb heart which was amazing and surprising.
There was an interesting day special: greens and pig cheeks.
St John has a wonderful service. The vibe is great and relaxed, many tables seemed to be having a great time. You can either visit for a serious elegant work meeting, a birthday party or just an unexpected informal lunch."
St. John,2.0,"To be honest this was kind of crap. I know it‚Äôs billed as nose to tail but you hope for something in between. All the options were ear, brain and trotter and there is a reason most of those are not on other menus. I‚Äôm happy with tripe if I can also have something that isn‚Äôt an offcut. Service and atmosphere were grand but the food was gross."
St. John,5.0,Went there with my friends and we have ordered a whole roast pig to share among all of us. The meat was so tender and delectable. Langoustine was finger-licking good. Absolutely dig the profiteroles.
St. John,4.0,"Friendly staff and fun atmosphere. The food was OK, a lot of fatty foods but I guess that's part of the cuisine. Makeral was excellent"
St. John,5.0,"I went to this restaurant about a year ago and forgot to give a review. Highly recommend for excellent British cuisine and often a creative twist to the dishes.
The interior is minimalist and quite bare, not my preference and can get a little loud sometimes. But a very good restaurant and worth making the effort to visit."
St. John,3.0,"Supposed to be one of the most well known and iconic restaurants on our Food Crawl dining venue list. This Michelin 1*,‚Äò nose-to-tail ‚Äò eatery, belonging to the legendary English chef Fergus Henderson, sadly turned out to be our trip‚Äôs only culinary disappointment!

Made famous and put on the foodie map by Anthony Bourdain. He called this institution his ‚Äòdream restaurant‚Äò in one of his ‚ÄòNo Reservation‚Äò episodes, praising the ‚Äòcomplete package‚Äò the restaurant has to offer. At that time, Henderson‚Äôs emblematic, simple and yet utterly delicious ‚Äò Roasted Bone Marrow with sea salt and Parsley Salad ‚Äò dish was just being unearthed by the culinary world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶resulting in chefs all over trying to emulate it and putting similar renditions on their menus.

We are by no means pointing fingers at our ordered food and giving them a ‚Äò thumbs-down ‚Äò. Some of our choices, at least components of them, indeed tasted pretty good. However, based on the restaurant‚Äôs reputation and modus operandi of ‚Äòless is more‚Äò and using a maximum of only 3 - 4 ingredients/components per dish. It is therefore expected that due to this simple and straightforward approach, the top-notched ingredients will be treated lovingly and prepared perfectly with skill and care. Sadly this was not the case. Our grilled Ox-Heart mains, for example, were over-cooked, dry and tough and accompanied by a bland, one dimensional, uninspirational sauce/jus.

Accompanying side dishes and salads followed a similarly sad pattern and result. Identical to some Indian restaurants‚Äô approach of using a generic ‚Äòmother sauce‚Äò eir curry base. St John's mirrors a similar mannerism with their dressing. During our visit, a monotonous Horseradish/Sour cream base concoction was broadly applied and used. Be it for our Veal tongue salad, the Ox-heart side dish or the side complement to our roasted Pheasant main! Where is the creativity usually found in Michelin star establishments?

However, there were certain stand-out dishes worthy of mentioning. The deeply flavourful Beef Broth, with ingredients similar to the traditional Scotch broth, but using beef instead of lamb, was a definite winner. The well seasoned, juicy and moist Pheasant dish is another thumbs-up dish‚Ä¶... .possibly one of the best tasting poultry dishes I have recently come across! Lastly, the Blood Orange Eton Mess dessert was absolutely out-of-this-world delectable! The Pear and Almond cake was pretty fine too.

Our lady server was most friendly, helpful and attentive, adding a crucial positive element to our dining experience!

In conclusion, a fine example of‚Ä¶.‚Äù You win some, You lose some! ‚Äú"
St. John,4.0,"St John, the establishment that triggered a British culinary revolution has still got ‚Äúit‚Äù! Getting a table at a convenient time can be challenging but it‚Äôs worth the effort. The barebones dining room looks like an East London workhouse given a moderate makeover, and the food is very British Beige, but tasty. The classic bone marrow on toast is great, and I can recommend the faggots and mash. The lemon posset was a bit underwhelming, or else it would have been a 5 star experience. Great selection of wines, though a few more options by the glass would have been nice.  Service was friendly and efficient."
St. John,5.0,"It was my third time here over several years and I wasn't disappointed. Consistency is not easy when you've been running for such a long time but somehow the St. John's crew have not only survived 2 years of pandemic but also kept the high quality standards their customers where and are used to. Ingredients and service where absolutely on point. I will single out the calf's liver, cooked to absolute perfection. Thank you"
St. John,5.0,"A perfect meal. Elevated, comforting flavours using great produce treated with care and not overfussed. The brill special of the day was exceptional as well as the date loaf with butterscotch sauce. Staff were helpful and friendly and the vibe of the restaurant is welcoming and tasteful. Highly recommend."
St. John,4.0,"We had the pleasure of ordering the Halibut and the Pork, both of which were exquisite. The Halibut was cooked to perfection, adorned with a beautiful sauce and accompanied by delectable sides that complemented the fish wonderfully. The Pork was tender and succulent, with a crispy skin that added a satisfying texture to the dish. However, the skin was a bit challenging to cut and bite through, which slightly detracted from the overall experience.

To accompany our main courses, we ordered additional greens and a salad, both of which exceeded our expectations. The cooked greens were expertly seasoned, likely with a rich ingredient such as butter, elevating the dish to new heights. The salad was a refreshing and well-balanced mix, with a delightful citrusy dressing that tied all the components together harmoniously."
St. John,5.0,"Amazing meal at St. John‚Äôs in London! Each dish was bursting with flavour and cooked to perfection. The staff were warm and friendly, creating a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere. The roast lamb, John Dory and house wine were particular highlights. It easily ranks among my top five restaurants in the world, and I can‚Äôt wait to return!"
St. John,5.0,"Best to make a reservation as the restaurant fills up by about 1pm, although you can still sit in the bakery area. The bone marrow is definitely something to order, and the turbot fish is really good too. The rarebit was a little heavy with the rest of the meal but it‚Äôs a good one. The pig‚Äôs tongue was something many tables ordered and worth a try too."
St. John,4.0,"Good was delicious, service was prompt and friendly. I don‚Äôt know how they do it, but I love the way they did their greens. The beetroot was juicy and sweet. Pea mash was heavenly. They also have special menus for the day, would have loved to tried their eel pie. Portion looks huge.

Note that there‚Äôs an outdoor bakery and a dining restaurant on the inside. Honestly would go back for the dining and tried out their bakes and coffee if back again. Honestly price wise I think it‚Äôs reasonable in relation to the food portion."
St. John,5.0,"Amazing experience, the food was incredible and so well thought out, not like anywhere else you can eat in London. For such a high end place, it did not have a snooty atmosphere, it wasn‚Äôt bad prices and the staff were so lovely.

My husband and I started off with the bone marrow, razor clams and potted beef, all of which were incredible. We then had the crispy pork cheek, which was very rich but tasty, and kid kidneys which were divine. We then finished off with a very generous portion of treacle dessert. Paired with their house red which was delicious!

I couldn‚Äôt recommend enough, probably the best meal I have ever had!"
St. John,5.0,Absolutely great experience. They definitely  are very clever in appreciation of not just the outside but the inside of the school. Must try bone marrow and parsley. Definitely get some fresh Madeleines baked. Make sure you book ASAP.
St. John,5.0,"Proper good food from start to finish. We started with the venison and mackerel, our friends had the house classic bone marrow on toast. Then we shared the mega meat pie, hake, with sides of potatoes and greens, and Welsh rarebit. Phenomenal. Super friendly servers and a very non-fussy interior. Would highly recommend."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We had an amazing evening at Faros in London! The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äî the truffle pasta was rich, creamy, and packed with flavor, easily one of the best we‚Äôve ever had. The ravioli were equally impressive, perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. You can really taste the quality of the ingredients and the care put into each dish.

The drinks were also a highlight of the evening ‚Äî creative, well-balanced, and served with style. The atmosphere was warm and vibrant, and the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive without being overbearing.

Faros exceeded our expectations in every way. We‚Äôll definitely be back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience in London!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The atmosphere and the food were great. I especially recommend trying the risotto. The staff were warm and attentive, making us feel at home. Everyone was lovely, but with Ruby it felt like we had known each other for years. I can definitely recommend Faros with peace of mindüòç"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"5‚òÖ ‚Äì A great experience from A to Z!

Faros Restaurant is the perfect place if you are looking for excellent food, friendly service and a beautiful interior. The food was exceptionally tasty ‚Äì fresh ingredients, perfectly seasoned and beautifully presented.

The staff were very nice, professional and always smiling. The whole lunch went without a single mistake. The atmosphere is stylish yet cozy ‚Äì ideal for lunch with a partner or with friends.

I definitely recommend Faros to anyone who wants to enjoy great cuisine in the center of London. I will definitely be back!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Traditional Italian cuisine. The pizza is made exactly right, with thin crust and soft cheese melting in your mouth, the pepperoni is good quality with strong flavor. The service is also impeccable- Ruby is very attentive. The atmosphere is cozy and nostalgic with good sound tracks in the background. We will definitely come back again."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We had a lovely family dinner at Faros London this evening. Although there was a small issue during the meal, it was quickly addressed by the management in a professional and efficient manner. I truly appreciate how responsive and helpful the team was.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the overall service was great. Special thanks to the management and staff for turning things around so smoothly and making our family gathering a pleasant experience."
Faros Oxford Circus,2.0,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the experience at Faros. Me and my partner visited on a weekday lunch since it had a very high rating, and we wanted to try it out.

We had calamari fritti and octopus carpaccio for starters. Calamari was one of the toughest I've had. Octopus carpaccio had no flavour despite me trying desperately to get any flavour out of it. :D

The mains were better. Margherita pizza was nice, simple but tasty, with thin base. Seafood risotto had a big problem of tough seafood, not feeling fresh at all. Beef ragu pappardele was okay. Just expected deeper flavours with beef ragu cooked for 6 hours. Overall price and quality of food did not match.

Sitting space was very limited. We had a tiny table with barely enough space for 2 plates, cutlery, and glasses. In addition the table next to ours was very close. I was worried of smn sitting there since we would definitely have intervened in each other's spaces.

Service was good. However, I feel like the restaurant is trying to overcompensate poor food quality and high prices with overly attentive service."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Came to Faros in February. This is the best meal I‚Äôve ever had. Food was exceptional, and the staff were more than happy to give me as much basil as my heart desired (which is an absolutely obscene amount‚Äîmuch more basil was brought after this photo was taken). Service was incredible. Chef and his son are adorable. I wish I could eat at Faros every night. Every single course was a work of art. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Amazing restaurant. Super clean, food is fresh and delicious and our waitress Riya is just the sweetest person and offered excellent service. Definitely will be back."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"My wife and I celebrated our 51st anniversary at this wonderful restaurant,   the food variety and quality was outstanding.

We had a wonderful time in very elegant surroundings.
We highly recommend this restaurant, we will be back in the near future."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"It's so wise to choose this restaurant for your birthday this time! The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was immediately drawn in by its warm and elegant atmosphere. The soft lighting and soothing music blend perfectly, and every corner is filled with a sense of ceremony. The dishes are delicious. Waiter Mehmet provided meticulous and measured service throughout the meal, always paying attention to the needs without disturbing the dining rhythm. I had unforgettable birthday memories here. Both the food and the service were impeccable. Highly recommended!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,We were hosted by Ozzy and his service was amazing. He was friendly as well as very attentive. Food was lovely. Thank you for creating such a memorable experience for us!
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Exceptional experience, the food was excellent the fresh truffle pasta was delicious, as were the other dishes the other guest had, our glasses were never empty. The staff were kind and accommodating, special thanks to Mehmet, the atmosphere was light and the decor and music was timeless. Great for a lunch dressed casually or a dinner dressed up. They also surprised us with a birthday cake and song, would recommend."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had a great dinner at Faros! The Calamari Fritti was crispy and tender, and both the Risotto Mare and Linguine Allo Scoglio were rich and full of flavor ‚Äì we all loved it. Finished with a perfectly balanced Tiramisu, not too sweet.

Big thanks to Ozgur for the friendly and attentive service! Will come back againüíï"

Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"Very nice upscale restaurant in Oxford Circus. My family was seeking Italian food while on holiday in London and we found this place via Google reviews. We were not disappointed. The setting was great, the server was nice and patient and the food was amazing. The portion sizes are a little small considering the price. This was the only restaurant we visited that hit us with a VAT tax charge as well as a 12.5% service charge. The restaurant was packed and it was loud but we could still talk and enjoy our meals."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The most beautiful surprise, we had accidentally come to this restaurant and were not disappointed at all. No comments about the food, go taste it for yourself, it‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Also you will be lucky if Fozil is your waiter ( very kind guy ). Much recommended"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Wonderful Italian restaurant in SoHo. We showed up with a family of 5 without a reservation (not recommended!!). The staff was kind and accommodating. They turned the heaters on outside and even offered a lap blanket to my wife. Pasta was delicious and service was excellent. The vanilla ice cream was out of this world! We have spent the last week trying to find it for purchase. Pricey to feed a large family but worth every penny.
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Decided to go here on a whim and it was completely worth it. The restaurant was beautiful, the food was amazing (the best Italian food I‚Äôve ever had) and the staff was warm and welcoming. It was an overall exceptional dining experience. I absolutely recommend checking this place out if you are ever in the area."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had a fantastic experience at this Italian restaurant! Went with my husband and little one, super kid friendly.. The pasta was absolutely delicious ‚Äî perfectly cooked and full of flavor. We also tried the tiramisu, and it was one of the best I‚Äôve had; light, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness. The venue itself is beautiful, with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. A special shoutout to our waiter, Ozzy Ozzy, who was so attentive throughout the evening. He gave us great recommendations from the menu and made sure everything arrived promptly. Great service really made the night. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back!"
Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"Overall, amazing vibes and super attentive service but for what it cost, the food doesn‚Äôt quite live up to the hype. Starters like the calamari and burrata salad were fresh and tasted good but nothing to write home about. I had the pappardelle beef ragu - this was comforting and tasted good but compared to my other experiences with this dish, it was alright. The chocolate bomb for dessert was great - I do really recommend this! And the complimentary limoncello shot was a nice touch."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Arrived at 6:00 on a Friday and they were busy, but luckily the host was very helpful and they were able to provide a table for 5 with no wait.
Our server Ozgur was outstanding, very attentive, with good recommendations on meals, and care to ensure everything was to our liking.
Highly recommended, but next time I will get a reservation."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We had beef carpaccio and calamari for starters, both of them were wonderful. We also ordered carbonara and porcini risotto, the carbonara was delicious and the tiramisu was great too. The service from Fozil was amazing, he was so nice and gave recommendations to us. It was a fantastic experience."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Came for dinner and the place was buzzing with activity. Despite how busy it was, the staff were incredibly helpful and efficient. Every dish we tried was delicious, but I especially recommend the prawns with artichoke and asparagus, as well as the pappardelle with beef ragu, both were outstanding. Make sure to book your table in advance, as it gets quite busy!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The staff is polite and attentive, Ozzy and his colleagues did their utmost to provide us with a wonderful eating experience.
The food was absolutely delicious - every dish was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.

We‚Äôll definitely be coming back, and highly recommend Faros to anyone looking for great Italian food in central London."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Excellent! My Caprese was lovely but would have liked one more slice of tomato and basil rather than the leaves provided which were not as full of flavour. However the Fresh Pappardelle Beef Ragu was sensational! Not cheap but well worth it
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Just had lunch. Food was amazing. The service was even better.

Ruby our host was incredible, we were celebrating our friend‚Äôs birthday and she was fantastic."

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I had their sourdough bread, burrata tagliatelle and tiramisu for dessert. Sourdough bread was not the best but the tagliatelle and the tiramisu were on point. My friends on the table loved their al fungi pasta and pizza. Staff were friendly and accommodative of our requests!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Love the risotto. It tastes so delicious. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Italian cuisine
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had a wonderful dinner experience at Faros last week, that made us come back for  a second dinner three days later. The team at Farros were able to accomedate us and provide us with a table within five minutes of arrival without a prior booking. Even though the restaurant was relatively full. We were served by Ozzy who took very good care of us."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I've lost count of my visits, but every time feels like the first time I fell in love with this place. Personally, the star of their menu is undoubtedly the Calamari and the Truffle Pasta! Big thanks to our waiter Eggy, who was tremendously helpful and attentive."

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Last week, during our visit to London, we had the opportunity to experience this highly talked-about restaurant, which we had also come across on social media. As Manchester residents who frequently travel to London, discovering new culinary gems is always exciting for us.

I would particularly like to highlight the service‚Äî√ñzg√ºr looked after us exceptionally well, making our experience feel even more special. The presentation of the dishes was modern and creative, yet the authenticity of traditional flavours remained intact.

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"It's a good experience and the service is very good. Shrimp and squid rings are especially recommended for food, which are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Very authentic flavour and menu. Pleased to see affogato was on the menu and there were a variety of options for those who do not eat meat.

Will definitely be back next time we are in London"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We wanted to hate this place. The reviews can‚Äôt be true. Impossible for central London to be 4.9** but honestly.

Starter perfect, pesto great. Burrata fresh and not straight out the fridge.

Truffle pasta creamy and rich. Ragu plentiful and delicious. The desserts were also just lovely and light and the coffee was amazing.

Service also top notch and a song for my partners birthday was such a nice touch!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The food here is always amazing! I come here all the time and usually order the pasta and prawns. I‚Äôm quite picky with flavours, so it‚Äôs hard for me to find pasta and prawns that I really enjoy, but every time I get them here they‚Äôre made perfectly for me. Ozzy  is always very respectful and welcoming he makes my time here feel warm and enjoyable."

We were impressed by OZGUR professionalism and warm demeanor.
They truly enhanced our dining experience"
Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"Went on a Friday evening for an early dinner. We had a great time. The place itself has great decor, with open kitchen and bar. We shared all the dishes- Burrata salad, garlic bread, pizza and two pastas.

The menu offers great variety for vegetarians. There are plenty of dishes to choose from and could add extra ingredients to dishes if it was possible.

We were served by Ozgur. He was attentive and helpful."

Nice service too and highly recommend."

Highly recommend asking for him if you visit!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The food was simply delicious, each dish bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. Ozzy‚Äôs friendly and attentive service made the evening truly special ‚Äî he was quick to anticipate our needs and added a personal touch that made us feel at home. Highly recommended!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Faros, and I must say, it was an experience that truly stood out. From the moment I walked in, the classy yet homely atmosphere created an inviting and comfortable environment. The d√©cor strikes a perfect balance between elegance and warmth, making it ideal for both special occasions and a refined, casual meal.

To start, I ordered the minestrone soup, which was absolutely delicious. The broth was rich and well-seasoned, with a generous variety of fresh vegetables that gave it both texture and depth of flavor. The soup was served with bread, though I did find myself wishing for a bit of butter to accompany it ‚Äì a small touch that would have made the starter perfect.

For the main course, I opted for the fresh pappardelle beef ragu, and I can confidently say it was one of the best pasta dishes I‚Äôve ever had. The pappardelle itself was cooked to perfection ‚Äì tender with just the right amount of bite ‚Äì while the beef ragu was bursting with flavor. The sauce was rich, hearty, and clearly made with high-quality ingredients, creating a dish that was both comforting and indulgent.

Given the quality of the food and the overall high-end feel of the restaurant, the prices were on the higher side, but that‚Äôs to be expected for a place of this caliber. Honestly, considering the taste and presentation, I felt the meal was well worth the cost.

Service was another highlight of the evening. The staff were exceptionally friendly, attentive without being overbearing, and the food arrived impressively quickly. It‚Äôs clear that Faros prides itself not just on its menu but on delivering a complete dining experience.

Overall, my visit to Faros was outstanding. The combination of delicious food, quick and friendly service, and a classy yet cozy ambiance makes it a place I‚Äôd highly recommend. If you‚Äôre looking to treat yourself to an unforgettable meal, this is definitely the spot to visit."

We went on a Friday evening and booked a table on the same day, but considering it‚Äôs a busy place and all the tables were full, I would recommend booking at least few days in advance.

I would recommend, it is a very pretty place with a chill atmosphere."

Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Wonderful food, great selection of lunch/dinner options, drinks, and desserts - everything was fantastic and great value! The atmosphere was nice too, and it was no surprise that the queue was long (worth the wait) and tables all full. The staff were all so friendly and helpful too :)"
Govinda's Soho Street,3.0,"I tried the ¬£7.95 Veggie Thali at Govinda‚Äôs London, and overall it was a mixed experience. The food itself was quite average ‚Äî while the portion was fair, the flavors didn‚Äôt really stand out. The service also wasn‚Äôt the best. The server seemed impatient which affected the overall experience.That said, the place itself has a nice, homely vibe, and it feels welcoming if you‚Äôre looking for a simple vegetarian meal at a reasonable price."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I've visited Govinda's Restaurant two weeks ago, and I've enjoyed in great food and ambience, that not only filled my stomach, but also my soul. I was inspired with beautiful and peaceful energy! Service was also great and people were always full of laughter! I'm definetily looking forward to visit this place again someday! Greetings from Croatia! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"First time eating at Govinda and was definitely not disappointed. The food was fresh and tasty. Great selection. We got the large platter as we wanted to try a selection of the food on offer. The staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful.
Really relaxed atmosphere. I will return for sure!!!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"A Nourishing Experience at Govinda‚Äôs

Just shared a beautiful meal with an old friend at Govinda‚Äôs in London, and I‚Äôm still glowing from the experience. This vegetarian gem which caters for vegans with ease has such a warm, spiritual feel - it‚Äôs more than just food, it‚Äôs soul nourishment. The cuisine was absolutely fantastic: fresh, flavourful, and prepared with love. The staff were genuinely friendly and welcoming, adding to the sense of being cared for. A perfect blend of taste, atmosphere, and heart. Highly recommend for anyone craving more than just a meal."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"One of the last remaining gems of old soho! This place has soul and community, not just because of its spiritual roots, but because of its community engagement, accessible food prices and even free food! It‚Äôs so heart warming it‚Äôs survived so long and the people that work here are great!

Food is always delicious, hearty and filling, especially for the price! It can get very busy so during the week I recommend around 7pm to come and eat.

Thank you!"
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,"Food was fantastic and reasonably priced. Has a very Mom and Pop kinda feel to it. Not a ton of seating, but if you get lucky you can grab an outside table."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Delicious vegetarian food and lovely atmosphere! I returned several times during my recent stay in London and found the variety of options, portions and prices most agreeable. Highly recommend!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"All the food we ordered was delicious and really cheap, can‚Äôt recommend it enough! That being said keep in mind that this place is really popular and gets crowded so you will probably need to wait for some time to get food. Also it was really hot inside so we had to get everything as a takeaway."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,this was a super yummy thali!! very decently priced - i got the veggie & my friend got the deluxe which got good reviews. the berry lassi is amazing and also vegan so was very happy with this!! there is a big queue but people move fast and the staff were v friendly. would def return :))
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"The most delicious vegan and pure vegetarian food available here, mist visit if you want to enjoy such food and also the atmosphere is great. There are lots of other Indian snacks also available at a reasonable price. We also tried srikhand which is a dessert and it was delicious as well, I would have liked it more if the quantity was a bit more but overall it was a nice experience. Checkout the prices in the videos and the food as well. Hare Krishna üôèüèª"
Govinda's Soho Street,3.0,"Went to this place as read some good reviews and watched some videos on YouTube and must say was disappointed
The place was busy as we went for the lunch time so  expected it to be busy
The service was really bad and I was disappointed by this, I know it was busy the person on the till wanted me to make a donation and I was not too keen
I had the deluxe thali and the puri had all the oil from the fryer and when I asked can I have a different one she was not too keen
The veg samosa tasted nice
The curry with thali was a con, they were overloaded with veg and sag aloo had broccoli and cauliflower making it rubbish but it is also makes it look big
So very disappointing to experience and there is a lot of pressure to buy stuff or donate and I don‚Äôt like that
As a vegetarian the place did smell like I was in India but it didn‚Äôt taste as good
If you do go, go for the basic thali as that is worth the money if you go for anything then go for the first one of the thali which costs 7.99 and is most possibly the best option

So a no from me, like the temple and the ambience but the food is not just that good and the service can be better"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Excellent authentic food served by great people, Sujith, Krish and china aunty served best service. Must recommend to all devotees and great place for family. Hare Krishna"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Awesome food with best service in London. Got a really temple vibe. Very friendly and helpful staff too. Much recommended
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"We had a wonderful family lunch at Govinda‚Äôs in Soho, and it exceeded our expectations on every front. The food was wholesome, flavorful, and served with the kind of freshness that makes you want to come back often. The ambience strikes the perfect balance between warmth and simplicity, making it a welcoming space for both families and individuals.

What really stands out is the value for money,
considering its prime location in the heart of London, Govinda‚Äôs is refreshingly affordable without compromising on quality. The staff were courteous and attentive, which added to the overall experience.

A hidden gem in central London for anyone looking for delicious vegetarian fare in a relaxed and family-friendly setting. Highly recommended!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I‚Äôve been eating at Govindas for many years. The food is delicious wholesome and very well priced for central London. Despite being Hare Krishna infused, you find people from all walks of life eating there. It is a welcoming satvic environment üôÇ"
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,"nice lunch experience, full of straightforward well seasoned and heartwarming flavors:]    though the bread felt a bit stale and bland:[
there‚Äôs a lot of queue so come early!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Stylish, elegant and cozy art deco style restaurant with high quality and comfortably furnished seating, gourmet food and friendly service. It's recommended to book a table here in advance, as it's quite a popular place in a really active part of London. Especially recommend the tuna tartare, which is not only delicious, but also presented in an inventive way. Great experience and a pleasant time spent!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"Beautiful atmosphere with an elegant 1920s vibe‚Äîtruly stunning setting. The food was delicious, but unfortunately the service didn‚Äôt match the experience. We didn‚Äôt feel very welcomed, were rushed to order, and our server was quite inattentive. Every table around us received bread before their meals, but we didn‚Äôt. Our food took about 40 minutes to arrive, and basic condiments for the chips weren‚Äôt offered. Drink refills came after we had finished eating. With the right service, I‚Äôm sure our experience would‚Äôve been much better."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Original Ivy, West End is in a great location for theater goers!  Rather busy on a Monday night.  Service is fast.  I had the zucchini fries and the vegetable risotto which I loved.  For dessert, I had the truffles which were rich and decadent!  The bar menu is inventive and filled with many great cocktails.  Like most London restaurants, this one is small but feels much more cozy and comfortable than others."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"Wanted to visit the Ivy Original for a long time as we usually go to another one. From the outside it was little disappointing as the pavement and streets are little neglected and maybe would be nice to see some planters to brighten it up. However, on arrival the guy at the reception was very welcoming and the atmosphere and music really nice and sophisticated. The starters - watermelon  salad and gazpacho were delicious. Main course - shepherd's pie little disappointing, there was no garnish and found a couple of small pieces of bones. The dessert was disappointing too as the caramel sauce was not hot enough to melt our chocolate bombs. To be honest I am not surprised as the service was slow, the kitchen person would bring dishes into the trays and would not even call waiters to serve it. So effectively the dishes were sat there waiting to be served. Also a few discrepancies on the bill, some miscellaneous charges were added and the waiter could not explain what it was... Lovely venue but the service and food quality is not what it used to be and adding ¬£4 here and there  is not right. I guess most of people do not check but we had ¬£4 added and 2 charges of ¬£2 so ¬£8 in total - and they could not justify the charges"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Original Ivy in the West End was a treat.
Our Italian waiter was fantastic ‚Äì attentive and genuinely friendly, making the whole experience better.
The food was delicious. The Shepherd's Pie was rich and comforting with melt-in-your-mouth lamb and a perfect potato topping.
The fish and chips were spot on ‚Äì fresh, flaky haddock in crispy batter with great chips. Even the Ivy Burger was impressive, a juicy and flavorful classic.
The atmosphere is cozy and elegant, definitely a lovely spot for a special meal for decent prices.
Highly recommended."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"If you want to have a meal at an iconic restaurant then this is the place. You will experience the best service possible in the most delightful setting, ideal for the theatre or an unforgettable dining experience.
It's not cheap but That does not matter as what you get is what you pay for. Everything I had was perfect and the choices were enough for me to find choosing difficult.
Don't put off this experience. They really look after allergies with careful attention to gluten free choices."
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,The food presentation and cozy vintage ambiance were exceptional. Food was a bit pricey for the quality and quantity. I would return for the decadent Golden Hazlenut Bomb dessert - melting chocolate and vanilla dome with 24ct gold leaf and a hazelnut chocolate caramel sauce.  You watch as the waiter melts the chocolate dome containing ice cream with a warm caramel sauce.
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Absolutely phenomenal! The food was outstanding, the staff were so kind and incredible, and the environment was beautiful. Fantastic dinner before a show!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,The Ivy is a fantastic place that serves British food. I loved the atmosphere and there was live music during our visit. We tried the main 2 dishes: shepards pie and haddock & chips. Both were tasty and their portions are big.
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"Delicious food. Great service. Fab 1920s feel. Music a bit loud. Busy but not uncomfortable. Paid for water, unnecessary. I always think this is a trick to get more money. Overall lovley time."
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"Beautiful place, friendly staff. The food was delicious although some of it was a bit pricey, but everything we got, we liked! When we go back, I want to get the fish and chips this time, my husband got it and it was great!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"There is a reason that the IV in the west end is famous! Great food, and such a fun atmosphere. We were absolutely lucky to get reservations right at the bar just prior to our viewing of The Mousetrap, and it was the perfect combination for a wonderful evening."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"A first visit to this legendary establishment. Fantastic food, delicious cocktails, perfect ambiance and friendly staff.

Dorset crab, cheese souffl√©, crab linguine and The Ivy Shepherds pie ü•∞

We will be back"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"If you're heading to the West End for a show, and you appreciate good food, excellent service, quality cocktails in a historical and well appointed restaurant, a visit to The Original Ivy should be added to your itinerary.

Everything was perfect. I don't think they would accept anything less.

We had the Ivy Classic Crispy Duck Salad (‚Ç¨13.95) as an appetizer and the Shepherd's Pie with Mayfield Cheese (‚Ç¨21.95) and the Lamb Rendang Curry (‚Ç¨29.50) as entr√©es.

Thr duck salad was delightful with a variety of flavors that popped in your mouth.  Roasted cashew nuts provided some great texture, and the sesame and watermelon were still able tol shine through despite a light hoisin dressing.

As it was my first visit to London, I had to try some Shepherd's Pie.  Their version of the classic English dish was wonderful.  The gravy was excellent.  I elected to add the Mayfield Cheese, which was the right choice.  I saw at least six other patrons eating this dish, including the table next to us.  He was pleased with it, too.

We paired the meal with a few different wines, Ivy has an extensive list.  Do try their Honey Galzed Almonds (‚Ç¨4.50) with your opening cocktail.

We finished with the Selection of Cheeses (‚Ç¨13.95) and some Chocolate Truffles (‚Ç¨6.95).  There are five cheeses on the plate  along with an apple and apricot chutney.  A good blend of tastes from savory to sweet.  I did not enjoy the accompanying crackers. They tasted like cardboard.  Maybe ask for some bread instead.

The warm, inviting, and spot-on service starts when you walk in the door.  The meal was flawlessly executed. Great advice on wines and food choices, too.

Just a few blocks to the theater.  Thank you Ivy!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"We had a nice lunch with a group of 8 friends over the summer while staying at the nearby Ham Yard hotel.

We had appetizers, entrees and desserts for the table and everyone enjoyed the food, particularly the appetizers and desserts.  The cocktails were also well made.

Our server was pleasant and attentive, despite it being a crowded lunch service.  The restaurant is beautiful, but definitely hot inside.

I would recommend checking it out if in London."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Having arrived early we were sat at the bar and the bartender quickly took our order but our table became available fore he could deliver the drink. So they were forwarded to the table. Each of my drinks were a delight, having had the espresso martini and the berry rum bramble. My appetizer was the tuna tartare and the avocado was fresh giving a nice under lying flavor to the chilled raw tuna. Following that was the crab linguine special. The noodles were cooked to perfection and the crab was a delight. My dessert was the Ivy chocolate bombe. All I can say about this is AMAZING, save room for dessert. If you‚Äôre in the area for a show or need a dinner spot. This has to be a top selection."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"I‚Äôve visited the Ivy over the years and I was a little disappointed tonight. The atmosphere is great and service great. They used to make a killer hamburger, not sure why a tough overcooked one is in the menu. Rib eye steak was okay, red wine sauce was tasty. Mashed potatoes were bland. I like to leave positive reviews but I have to be honest too / I wish ‚Äòbubbles and squeak‚Äô was still on the menu. I had a Canadian WWII friend who told me in the 1990s that the cooks would feed him and other soldiers during the war - pretty great! I think of the Ivy as an English institution. There were several dishes missing from the menu sadly. The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was the best part of the meal. Definitely recommend! Great place for a quick bite before catching a show in the area."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,Took my husband here before our Theatre Show as a treat.  Wow it was fantastic.  The food was gorgeous and all the staff were a credit to the Ivy.  Thank you all for a lovely and special evening.  (Just wish I had seen Cliff Richardü§£ xx
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,I took my Korean friend to have a good experience of British dinner. We had a two course meal with complimentary bread. We had a wonderful time catching up on our lives and a good1 meal.
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"A staple for locals and a few tourists.  Fish pie is wonderful, creamy with lobster shrimp salmon.  10 quid martinis special.  And by all means save room for sticky toffee pudding, and a chocolate bomb too!  Under 150 quid for 2: 4 drinks, app, 2 mains, dessert!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The wonderful original Ivy restaurant in West Street London and still the best of the Ivy Collection. On a very busy Saturday evening in the West End (24/08/2024) it was an oasis of calm. Of course, it isn't as it was years ago when staff had individual roles, eg, a cocktail waiter, a sommelier etc., but our server was excellent as was the food and drinks. An evening at the Ivy doesn't come cheap but who would want it any other way. A place to go for a special occasion. Extras include service @ 13.5% + a ¬£2 cover charge per person.

Update 11/03/2025:- Came again for a celebratory evening and enjoyed another superb meal. Don't get me wrong our server was lovely but maybe not ""quite"" as professional as the one we had last year ü§î It's a tiny criticism. We only had a cocktail each and no wine which brought the bill down considerably. Footnote of possible interest: my father, a young Frenchman living in London, was a cocktail waiter at the Ivy in the 1930s so it has a very special place in my family's heart ‚ù§Ô∏è More photos added."
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"The food and atmosphere were great, but the service was disappointing. It was my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday on the day we visited, so I requested a birthday plate in advance. Even though I double-checked both by phone and online, they completely forgot. On top of that, they also forgot our order, which caused a delay and made us late for our musical. Honestly, the service wasn‚Äôt worth the service charge."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Their pre-theatre menu is amazing! Two courses for ¬£29.99, we opted for mains and dessert.
Everything was full of flavour. The portions are on a smaller side but that‚Äôs expected. You‚Äôd need an extra side dish also."
"The Original Ivy, West End",1.0,"We dined at The Ivy West End before a show and unfortunately, it was a letdown. Service was incredibly slow‚Äîwe were nearly late for the performance despite ordering from the theatre menu. Staff seemed distracted and inattentive throughout or just very poorly organized. The food didn‚Äôt redeem the experience: the lamb was served raw, portions were disappointingly small, and overall quality was poor. The only saving grace was the chocolate bomb dessert, which was genuinely delightful. However, given the high prices and underwhelming service, it‚Äôs not worth it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to others."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I am giving this restaurant an all FIVE STARS. Location is excellent and easy to access. The food is super delicious.
The best of it all is the service. The staff are so friendly, welcoming and caring.
The atmosphere is warm and friendly with lots of beautiful vibes. It's a place to visit and I will go there again and again. I will recommend Original Ivy to everyone.
Thanks to a wonderful staff team."
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"We had booked this lunch meal as a treat for me and my wife., looking forward to the experience. The Original Ivy has had a great reputation for years. Unfortunately it fell short of expectations and I will never be returning .

Despite having a reservation, we were made to queue for 15 minutes before being seated. Once inside, the service was inconsistent: we had to repeatedly ask for water, and waited between 45 to 60 minutes for our main course, while other tables were served far more promptly. The cheese souffl√© arrived cold, and the fish in the fish and chips was dry, with chips that were warm but not hot. We were also charged a cover fee despite no bread being presented.

While we appreciated the gesture of a discount at the time, it didn‚Äôt make up for the overall experience, which felt far below the standard we had anticipated. The only highlight was the martini, which was excellent!

Unfortunately this was the second bad ‚Äú Ivy‚Äù experience I‚Äôve had recently, the last being at Richmond.

My sense is that maybe new ownership is milking a hard earned reputation and letting standards drop in the name of profit- I could be wrong, hope I am.

Good luck guys."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"We went there for fish and chips. We had to make a reservation. They take your coat to the front desk and give you a number to return it. The food was the best fish and chips that we tried in London.
The atmosphere is cozy and calm, considering we are in Europe, and everything is smaller and tighter than in the US."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Went with kids, pleased they had a kids menu. Food in general was very good, cocktails and desert even better. service was stellar."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I had the pleasure of dining at The Ivy recently, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The food was absolutely delicious. it's clear that the chefs take great pride in their craft.

What truly stood out, however, was the service. From the moment we arrived, the hostess Ms. Binta, made us feel right at home. She greeted us with a warm smile, was attentive without being overbearing, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the evening. Her friendly demeanor and professionalism added a personal touch that really made the experience special."
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"Went to The Ivy thinking it was going to be something special, however, the tables are placed so close to each other I could hear the conversation from the tables either side of us - it just felt so clostrophobic. I'm guessing the tables are so close so they can get as many covers in as possible but this ruins the atmosphere. You just cannot talk in a normal voice, you have to whisper unless you want the tables either side of you knowing what you're talking about. Shame really.
The food wasn't that special either.
Been there, done that. Tick in the box but will not be going there again. There are far better places in London and cheaper than The Ivy to eat."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"As always, our visit to the Ivy was brilliant. Super set menu, lovely atmosphere and perfect for a pre show meal!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Had a fantastic meal here, the food was amazing and certainly worth the money, try the Shepherds pie which is to die for.

The staff were efficient and did all they could to speed our meal up before the concert.

A truly perfect meal, Thanks to the manager Karim."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Loved it so much. Great service amazing vibes in a beautiful, characterful and vintage interior. Liked that it is fairly relaxed while feeling sophisticated and food prices and very reasonable. Food was fantastic too. Great shepherds pie and steak tartare!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I recently had lunch at The Ivy in London with my girlfriend, and it was a fantastic experience. I opted for the Malaysian Curry, which was really flavourful and perfectly spiced, while my girlfriend enjoyed the Tuna Steak, which was cooked to her perfection. Both meals were delicious felt of high quality. The  atmosphere was pleasant, with a traditional & stylish setting that made our lunch feel special. Overall, it was a delightful dining experience, and we can‚Äôt wait to return!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"I‚Äôve always liked the Original because of the decadent design. Food is always on par but I do feel it‚Äôs over all too quickly. Starters appear with minutes of ordering followed immediately by dinner and dessert. I think the whole visit was just over an hour. I assume they like a quick turnover?
Staff are a little tense but overall it‚Äôs a nice experience"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"From the moment you step inside The Ivy, you are greeted with an atmosphere of classic elegance and charm. The restaurant‚Äôs sophisticated interior, paired with impeccable service, makes for an unforgettable dining experience.

The Culinary Highlights

Starter: The smoked salmon was a delight‚Äîfresh, buttery slices adorned with cucumber, microgreens, and cr√®me fra√Æche, complemented by dark rye bread. A light yet flavorful beginning.

Main Course: A beautifully cooked steak, topped with a rich b√©arnaise sauce, served alongside crispy golden fries. A perfect balance of indulgence and refinement.

Dessert: The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was a masterpiece‚Äîsilky smooth custard beneath a perfectly caramelized, crisp sugar crust. A divine way to end the meal.

With an atmosphere that blends history, sophistication, and culinary excellence, The Ivy truly lives up to its reputation. Every bite was a testament to the restaurant‚Äôs commitment to quality, making this visit an absolute delight.

Would I return? Absolutely!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"It‚Äôs been over a month since our visit to Ivy, yet we‚Äôre still reminiscing with gratitude about the exceptional hospitality of the charming hostess, Ksenia. She truly saved our Saturday evening by accommodating our spontaneous request to extend our reservation. Her attentiveness, kindness, and understanding were beyond impressive.

The food was delicious, the service impeccable, and the ambiance simply delightful. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience.

Thank you, Ksenia, for making our visit so memorable. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The food is fantastic, albeit overpriced for some things, IMHO. The service was impeccable and it seemed all we had to do was think about getting the server‚Äôs attention and someone would show up asking if we needed anything.
The interior is a bit dated and looks like it doesn‚Äôt know what kind of restaurant it wants to be.  This is a chain, with many locations. I‚Äôve been to a few and they are fairly consistent with this review."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Amazing food! Arancini was to die for, absolutely delectable. Highly enjoyed every course, absolutely worth the money"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The food and vibe are fantastic, but know that service can be a bit slow. That being said for a night out on Soho it's the perfect place to start."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Ivy offers an exceptional dining experience with incredibly delicious food. The menu features a selection of classic English dishes alongside numerous vegetarian options, which are available on a separate menu.

The staff are incredibly attentive, ensuring a pleasant dining experience.

The interior is very traditional and beautifully decorated, adding to the overall charm of the restaurant.

The food is truly delectable. It is advisable to reserve a table a few days in advance to ensure availability."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Ivy original hits differently than the other ones anywhere in London.
The place is rather small so I recommend booking in advance.
Food was brilliant.
The ivy has high standards and it rarely disappoints!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"I love the Ivy and have been to many of them across the country, I was disappointed with our meal at London City Garden though.
We were offered water, which we expected to be a fair cost, but ¬£11 for 2 glasses, felt totally unnecessary. Especially as the water retails at ¬£1.50 a bottle.
My starter and main meal (chicken Milanese)  was very bland - I gave up half way through. My husband ordered a steak and a side of creamed greens which tasted off and he left them.
The service was lovely, as was atmosphere. They were also good at receiving feedback and offered a refund on the items we didn‚Äôt like;  but I have to say I won‚Äôt return in a while as the water price just felt like needless profiteering."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"Great food, friendly service. Perfectly cooked beef wellington. They decided to seat another couple extremely close to us even though the restaurant was empty at the time. We had a hard time holding a conversation without it seemingly spread to next table. At least we influenced their meal since it was so close it was basically a display for them."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Original Ivy is one of those places I keep coming back to every time I‚Äôm in London, it‚Äôs right in the heart of the West End and perfect before or after the theatre, the Shepherd‚Äôs Pie is still the best I‚Äôve ever had and the tuna tartare and sea bass are always flawless, I ended the meal with the apple tarte tatin and ice cream which was warm, and just the right amount of sweet, the service is quick even when it‚Äôs packed like it was on a Wednesday night and everyone is so professional but friendly, the bar menu is creative with cocktails that actually surprise you, the space feels intimate and stylish without being pretentious, yes it‚Äôs pricey but totally worth it because the food and experience are just on another level, honestly it‚Äôs one of those meals you think about long after and always look forward to doing again."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I had an absolutely delightful experience at The Ivy West End. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was warm, elegant, and inviting, a perfect blend of classic charm and modern sophistication. The interior decor is beautifully done, with soft lighting, lush greenery, and a buzzing yet relaxed vibe that makes it feel both upscale and comfortable.
The service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed to care about the guest experience. My waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations without being pushy. I started thinking could this be my lucky day.
As for the food, it was outstanding. I ordered the crispy duck salad as a starter and the blackened cod for the main. Both were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavour. The dessert (a melting chocolate bombe) was pure indulgence and a fantastic end to the meal.
What really stood out for me was the attention to detail. From the beautifully presented dishes to the seamless service and ambience that complemented the dining experience without overpowering it.
Whether you‚Äôre celebrating something special or just want a memorable dining experience in the heart of London, The Ivy West End is well worth it. I'll definitely be back."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Had a fantastic dinner at The Original Ivy in the West End. The atmosphere is classy without feeling stuffy, and the staff were super friendly.

Would definitely go back!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"We dined at The Ivy West Street on the evening of 22nd May to celebrate a birthday. While we had high expectations for the experience, we unfortunately encountered extremely unprofessional service that deeply disappointed us.

After our mains, my friend kindly asked the waiter for dessert recommendations for a birthday celebration. His reply was simply, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù Later, when we politely asked to check the bill, he responded twice with ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚Äî leaving us confused, uncomfortable, and frankly, disrespected.

We were unsure whether the tone was meant to be humorous, but it felt inappropriate, especially in such a premium establishment. This was not what we expected from a restaurant of this reputation and price point.

We also reached out via email and the official contact form on their website shortly after our visit, but received no reply.

Attaching the bill here for reference ‚Äî we were Table #10, served by a staff member named Erdal. Hopefully this feedback will be taken seriously to prevent other guests from having a similar experience.

Highly disappointed, and sadly, this tainted what should have been a joyful birthday dinner."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"What a fabulous restaurant to dine. Attentive service, beautiful Art Deco decor and delicious meals were had by all of our party of 5.

"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I hadn‚Äôt been to a restaurant in The Ivy chain before so didn‚Äôt know what to expect. It was great, the decor is stylish, the staff friendly & helpful & the food was delicious. I found the food reasonably priced for London. Will be back to visit another soon."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"You can't beat the location and the food is reasonable. However, the service is poor.  Front-of-house and waiters were unfriendly and unwelcoming, we had to ask four times for the cocktails that we ordered before they were brought to our table, by which time  we had already had our starters delivered. There are other restaurants in central London that charge similar prices and have more charm."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Son took me for my birthday ,waitress was excellent.  Food was top quality üëå"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Reservations suggested! We did not have a reservation, and offered to sit at the bar, but were grateful to the hostesses that made accommodations to have a seated at a table. It did seem like we were inconveniencing them even though the restaurant was half empty (6:30 on a Monday) as they did allude to the fact that they were about to be very busy with tables coming in before nearby shows.

White tablecloth dining experience. Food was incredible and came out very fast! Honestly, my favorite thing I ate in all of London! They take English classics to the highest level of execution!

We didn‚Äôt get our cocktails until halfway through our meal that we ordered upon arrival - only reason for 4 stars on service. Our server was attentive (again - seemed like we were kind of an inconvenience) but regardless, we were checked in with and given speedy service. Gratuity fee 12.5% was already added to the bill.

Although the restaurant was a little warm for us, they did have silent fans dispersed throughout which helped. Aside from the warmth, the atmosphere was upbeat and lively, lots of well-dressed guests and families, enjoying this beautiful, eclectic and colorful restaurant!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"There was a live singer and she made the whole time there worth every minute. They food tasted better because of her! Fantastic! Great food, good portions. Kids did say their food wasn't that great but our adult food was super."
"The Original Ivy, West End",1.0,I would avoid this place. Rib eye had zero seasoning and was bland.  Mashed potatoes same.  Just a starchy taste.  Service was non existent. Fish was pretty good but missing sides I ordered.  Had to ask bartender for salt and pepper and I was sitting at a table. Not the bar.  Waiter disappeared and had to chase staff around for check. Never again.
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,Had s lovely meal the wife's beef Wellington was under cooked but they quickly replaced it and didn't charge us for it . Would definitely go back lovely atmosphere and friendly staff.
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"An upscale, art deco restaurant and bar in the heart of London. Staff engaging and professional. Delicious food and wine. Wonderful vegetarian menu; literally a separate menu so you don't have to sort it out on your own. Fresh and flavorful. I had the truffle ravioli. Wonderful with Sancerre!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,Yet another great meal at an Ivy restaurant.  Excellent food and service on the pre theatre menu. Well worth a visit. The onion soup was lovely as was the Sea Bream.
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I visited The Ivy on West Street over the bank holiday weekend to celebrate my mum‚Äôs birthday. The food ‚Äî both the starters and mains ‚Äî was pretty good, but the desserts were truly outstanding, especially the chocolate bomb! I highly recommend it.

Though the seating was quite tight, the atmosphere was lovely, and what made the experience even better was the exceptional service.
We were served by Francesco, who was absolutely fabulous!!! He was very attentive, friendly, and upbeat. He really elevated the whole experience, making it a definite 10/10!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"What an amazing experience it is dining at this restaurant!
It was my first time at a fine dining restaurant and I absolutely loved it, everything is done so right that you feel like you want to back again and again.
We started with some delicious cocktails at the bar while waiting to be seated at our table, when it became available we could enjoy our food.
We had delicious bread and butter to start, some cheese sufl√™ and some tempura prawns as starters, cottage pie and the breast chicken with a truffle filling for mains, and as desserts we had the valentines raspberry choux and the coconut sorbet, everything cooked to perfection.
The flavours are so well combined, completely different than anything I‚Äôve tried before.
The service is 5 stars, didn‚Äôt wait too long to get served, all the foods arrived with no time.
Our glasses never get empty as someone will refill it while we enjoy the amazing food.
There was someone playing a violin so beautifully, what a beautiful way of celebrating the Valentine‚Äôs Day!
I‚Äôll certainly be back!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"We ordered from here, Fish & Chips. No chips, no lemon but two slices of stale toast. The fish pieces were like 3.5‚Äù at best. One bite and gone and not even a good bite. $17 for what? Never again. Misrepresentation and no money back from Uber Eats."
"The Original Ivy, West End",1.0,"We booked our reservation months in advance for 6 PM‚Äîour first night back in London for our honeymoon. I studied at Oxford, so returning to the UK for this trip was incredibly meaningful to us. We were especially excited for a special evening at The Ivy, followed by a showing of The Mousetrap at St. Martin‚Äôs Theatre.

Unfortunately, the experience didn‚Äôt live up to the occasion. We were seated at a strange, awkwardly angled table where I couldn‚Äôt even face my wife‚Äîinstead, I was positioned directly across from another couple, who also seemed uncomfortable with the setup.

It took 25 minutes just to order a drink. We had to order our starters and mains all at once to make it to our play on time. Oddly, the mains arrived first, with the starter following a few minutes later. The food was underwhelming‚Äînothing bad, but certainly not what we expected from such a highly regarded restaurant. Comparable to decent street food at best.

Our server‚Äîwho had bandages on his face‚Äîseemed rushed and disengaged. Overall, it felt like the staff were just going through the motions, not delivering the warm, polished service we‚Äôd hoped for on such a special night.

We expected more from an establishment with The Ivy‚Äôs reputation. BE BETTER‚Äîfor the sake of your future guests, and for the experiences that should feel truly special.

Won‚Äôt be back and will tell friends to avoid."
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"Well it is The Ivy! Nice old decor and amazing ladies bathroom! Went for lunch and they have a great lunch menu for 2 courses for ¬£19 and add ¬£5 if you still have room for dessert.  Great choices for the lunch menu. We had the squid and bang bang chicken salad starters which were all very good. For main we all had the shepherds pie which was delicious! Served with gravy. Ordered a couple of sides, creamed spinach and green beans with almonds.
Dessert was frozen berries with sorbet and creme brulee which was delicious!!

Lovely ambiance and good service. Highly recommend it for lunch! Be sure to make a reservation though."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The most loveliest place I've been to. We booked on the day for a table and was greeted and taken to our seats. We had an amazing server who came and chatted. She was the highlight of the day! If you ever go to The Ivy just talk to the servers and chat to them. The downside was I went to the men's toilets and as I cupped my hands for the soap dispenser, it squirted up and onto my glasses and hair. White soap doesn't look good smeared on glasses after coming out of a bathroom. Although you may feel the prices are steep because of the location it isn't. I'd say it's on par with usual London prices. The service was amazing and the food was quick. Sheppard's Pie was delicious and although you have to wait 14 mins (a joke we had with our server), it's worth it for the experience. Really can't wait to go back. Really lovely."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"My husband arranged my birthday lunch at The Ivy. It was a few years since we have visited so it was great to return.

We received excellent, friendly and accommodating service and enjoyed the meal. The restaurant provided a delicious birthday cake, that my husband had arranged in advance.

It was a very special lunch and we were very well looked after.

Many thanks to the manager and staff."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Still my favourite restaurant of all The Ivy  Collections. Dined with my father and we were greeted by the wonderful Carolina and looked after by Karim the restaurant manager. Service and food were faultless.

The restaurant just oozes class and sophistication. Something very special."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Best Brasserie, restaurant all over London. Some can be pricy, but it's worth it. Everything is absolutely amazing, food, service, atmosphere. Each have their inside decor depending where The Ivy is located. Sublime"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Wonderful place to visit on a day out in London, made the whole experience feel very luxurious. Service was generally attentive but it was quite busy so difficult to pay attention to everyone at once. I myself had the scallops and the ravioli which was delicious with the shaved truffles on top, and the scallops were delicious with excellent presentation. They made my mum feel very special on her 60th birthday with a plate of chocolate truffles on the house, and for fairly fine dining, the price was not too exorbitant between 5 people."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"Lovely food, but the service really let the place down. It took more than 35 minutes for someone to come to take our order (after I had to ask someone for help) despite the restaurant being half full, and during the first course they came to take our plates before we were finished.

All in all, while I can not fault the food (the prawns are amazing), it isn't a place that I will rush back too."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"We went for Monday lunch and it was great. Place wasn‚Äôt busy, food was delicious and service was great. ¬£86 for 2 people including a beer each (1/2 pint). It would have been around ¬£70 without the beer. In summary, expensive but worth it and I‚Äôd definitely go back."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Decided to top our day off at one of London's iconic eateries - the Original Ivy, West End.  Reservations a must here, unless you want to take your chances finding a seat at the bar, which looked pretty full all night.  Since we got there a bit early, we started at the bar and enjoyed a great cocktail menu (they are not fooling around with their drinks - expensive, but very high quality).

We were seated in a comfy booth, and given a nice overview of the menu and specials.  We opted for a Spanish red wine that was delicious (their 15-page wine list is full of great options).  The food was all solid, no complaints at all, but for the price, nothing was truly exceptional ... not to say I wouldn't go back to explore more and different items.

The real fun started when our new-ish waiter attempted a table-side production for the Baked Alaska we ordered.  At one point I figure it was 50/50 odds that something not meant to be on fire was going to be on fire and our dessert ended up slightly over""baked"".  The real problem was the senior waiter that openly chastised the lad in front of several patrons, including some sneering and sideways glances of contempt for his younger colleague ... nobody spending 00+ a person wants to witness that kind of nonsense - take it to the back room next time.

Glad we went and experienced this place."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Lovely!
We visited in for my husbands birthday.
The service was outstanding.
All staff were lovely.
(I was slightly put off by a male member of staff that seemed to be a bit grumpy with some of the very hard working ladies there. I have no idea what he could be grumping about - as we found them all delightful)
Food was delicious - main and dessert.
Everything arrived quickly.
Cocktails were top notch.
The 'Happy Birthday' truffles for my husband were a very nice touch- we were not expecting it at all - which made it even nicer!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"While visiting London last during an extended layover, we decided to spend an evening enjoying dinner and a show. Looking to experience a classic yet unique British/ French dinning experience is what lead us to select The Ivy, on West St.

We were very impressed with the atmosphere and upscale experience provided by the staff. Unfortunately the food was not as elevated as the rest of our experience here. While atmosphere is important, we really try to make an extra effort to visit restaurants with quality foods to enjoy while exploring a new city.

I won‚Äôt go into detail about what we ordered as the menu has changed.

To keep this even shorter, superb vibes, clean restaurant, and excellent staff. However I would not return due to the lack lustre quality of the food that was served."
