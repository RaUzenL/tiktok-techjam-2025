Bennie Restaurant & Bar,8.0,Óóä
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"If you want amazing food in a laid back atmosphere highly recommend. The lamb rack was really tender, octopus was delicious and cooked perfectly and highly recommend the salmon tartare, so fresh! I agree with others that the branding makes it seem like another trashy chain restaurant but the reality was v different on arrival. It is a laid back atmosphere so don't expect michelin star service but the food was one of my favourite eats in London all year and all done to a great standard."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,4.0,"Bennie Restaurant and Bar ‚Äî a small and quiet spot with friendly service. The La Plancha king prawns were tasty and well-cooked, though the scallops fell a bit short of expectations. A cozy place for a casual bite, but not a must-return. Maybe it‚Äôs better for Breakfast."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"European fusion from France to Georgia. A great selection of wines. The baked zucchini flowers are unforgettable! Lovely live music and excellent service. We celebrated a birthday here, and it felt incredibly cozy and warm."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Firstly, a huge thanks and praise to Adi who was very attentive, helpful and provided 5-stars standards service us! He is a superstar especially with his recommendations. While we first thought our table by the door & DJ was not the best, we got to enjoy where we were in the end. The food from starters to dessert was delectable! Compliments to the chef and team. Anastasia was also provided a great service. Definitely a place we‚Äôre going to dine again in the future and will highly recommend."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Can‚Äôt fault a thing, great decor with also a few seats out front, food was great I very much enjoyed the octopus with a delicious chimichurri sauce complementing the sweet potato pur√©e extremely well (the cheesecake dessert was perhaps a bit underwhelming), but really the service is worth calling out, the waiters even offered another cocktail on the house! Thank you and will be back."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Out of this world food ,service, drinks a made by bartender who is very creative and professional, thank you Vlad.
Atmosphere is amazing and changes depending on the time of the day. DEFINITELY my Favorite spot to eat in London."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Bennie's Restaurant and Bar offers a delightful dining experience. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, perfect for a casual meal or a more celebratory occasion. The menu features a good selection of dishes, with a focus on fresh, high-quality ingredients. I particularly enjoyed the scallops and steak. The portions were generous, and the presentation was appealing. Service was attentive and friendly, making the entire meal a pleasant experience. A definite recommendation for those looking for a satisfying and enjoyable dining experience in London."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Great spot in the heart of Fitzrovia, food was absolutely delicious from starters ü•óto cocktails üç∏ , welcoming was super cozy, service was excellent. Highly recommend for date nights, brunch and family gatherings üëçüß°"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"The look of the actual menu online doesn't do this place justice (a 90s looking diners menu but a clean, spacious restaurant in person). We were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant today and enjoyed a team lunch for 10 people. Food was great quality, staff were friendly and we also enjoyed a discounted price due to booking online. Would definitely return and no complaints on food. Serving sizes were large as well, which was a plus. Great for big groups and those with dietary requirements"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"The food was delicious and good presentation. I would recommend it. Price is good, the portion size fills you up nicely."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Had some lovely seafood pasta here and my friend loved her food as well. Service was good and friendly. Would definitely return.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Delicious food and good service in a pretty setting.
The braised lamb is a must, so tender. Also really enjoyed the beef short rib and fried aubergine. Crispy mushrooms did not disappoint either - they lived up to the name!
Also got the short rib, burrata and fries which were more than enough.
Would recommend!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Was sceptical before booking even though this restaurant had been recommend to me by my dear friend and fellow-foodie-cum-dining-companion.

However, right from the moment our friendly waiter (without being too friendly) made some menu suggestions and was amenable to making changes (like offering the delicious pea and mint soup dairy-free), we knew we might be in for a treat!

The said soup was soup-er (better than this dreadful pun, let me assure you) and was seasoned delightfully, presented beautifully (as were all dishes) and if you wanted to add some Himalayan pink, rock salt or black pepper you could reach for the very original and charming twisters that dispensed both with appealing ease..

My friend's octopus on a sweet-potato puree base pleased her considerably, my cauliflower dish made what could otherwise have been a rather bland main perfectly enjoyable (and, generous a serving, too).  Fries were cooked to perfection and extremely plentiful (probably the biggest side portion we have ever had).

By the time it came to dessert, the thrill factor increased further!  My friend, who is originally from Ukraine, noted that the honey cake resembled the ones she grew up eating and started to suffer from a case of cake envy (as well as nostalgia) even though she liked her pistachio cheese cake.   Teas were served in rather charming, somewhat rustic cups and saucers and our second server was an endearingly sweet young girl who was equally friendly and professional as the first person.

All in all, this is a restaurant that does not need to try hard, has no pretensions to wow with interior decor gimmicks, even though there is nothing faulty with its simple but pleasing scheme.  Yet, I can confidently declare that far from the food being 'average' as some reviews have erroneously claimed, this is on the good to outstanding spectrum (including the Merlot glass of wine that we sipped throughout).

It's not cheap but it's not expensive and bearing in mind the location, the quality, beauty of presentation and delicate range of flavours on offer, I don't think one should grumble; one should let Bennie's food crumble with considerable contentment in the mouth!

We will be returning for sure and I commend those, like me, who might be unsure, to give it a try as I did!  You will love it!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Newly launched restaurant. Very comfortable and you feel the family vibe - rare occasion in Central London. Got some great dishes from European cuisine. Even if you are not fan of cauliflower, just go for it - they have done something incredible with it! And duck was amazing. Can‚Äôt wait to be back to try the rest of the items in the menu."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Met a coworker here for brunch, as we are both in London on personal holidays. Saw the good reviews and central location for us both and it was a good pick. We were the only ones at 1030, which was nice because we could chit chat and not feel rushed. Our server was sweet and we both loved our avocado toasts with poached eggs."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"We had very pleasant late lunch at Bennie's. Super attentive service. Tasty menu, my Pork Belly was tender and flavoursome. Also margaritas with Patron were top notch. Thanks a lot! Highly recommend and will visit again for sure."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Had a private dinner at Bennies and it was beautiful. The decor was the highlight, my guests loved the mirrors and the calming atmosphere. The food was nice, the quantity could‚Äôve been abit more on the plate but other than that it was amazing. The staff were friendly and accommodating! Definitely recommend"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,4.0,"Decided to come here for lunch. Restaurant does both brunch and ala carte dishes. Went for the grilled prawns and beef tartare. Service was fast on serving and the prawns were fresh. The main was a little bit disappointed. The grilled salmon, though was done perfect way but there isn‚Äôt any sauce go with this dish. There was some honey mustard that goes to the salad. We did request for additional mustard but didn‚Äôt get any. The pork belly, was hoping a bit crispy skin but just happened to be braised pork. It came with one side and selected sweet potato chips to go with. I think the carbonara saved the day for a bit with the combination of the cream, raw egg cracked to give a bit sticky creamy texture. The bill came and there was scan to pay but additional charge of 0.99 for doing so rather than covered part of it. Overall, nothing too memorable at this restaurant itself."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"We came here for Brunch. We had Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon and a Berry Meringue Roulade. Both are over the top dishes: perfectly balanced, great portion and rich in flavour. The service is excellent and the armosphere relax and warm."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"We went there on a saturday evening.
The service was great! They interacted politely, asking questions, and were up for a small chat.
The music and atmosphere were nice and cozy. Downstairs there was a party going on in the private room, but you could barely notice it!
The place is clean and looks very aesthetically pleasing. We had a comfortable seating area
The food was delicious! and honestly served like it came from a michelin star restaurant. For dessert I had the Pistachio cheesecake, which was divine. Defenitely recommend it!

If we care to being critical, just as everywhere else in London, they standardly have a 12.5% tip added to your bill. Additionally, we didn't receive a spoon when a pasta was ordered.

All in all, especially considering the price, great experience! You'd expect the bill to be way higher!
Definitely recommend going here and whenever I'll visit London again, I'll come back for sure!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"During my recent brunch at Bennie Restaurant and Bar, I decided to mix and match by ordering both the Eggs Benedict and the Avocado on Toast. This turned out to be an excellent choice that showcased the restaurant‚Äôs flair for classic brunch dishes with a modern twist.

The Eggs Benedict were spot on, featuring perfectly poached eggs with a runny yolk that complemented the rich, creamy hollandaise sauce. The English muffin was toasted to perfection, providing a nice contrast in texture. What set this dish apart was the quality of the ingredients ‚Äì the ham was flavorful and added just the right amount of saltiness to balance the dish.

On the other hand, the Avocado on Toast was equally impressive. The avocado was creamy and fresh, spread generously on a slice of perfectly toasted sourdough. The addition of pomegranate seeds was a delightful surprise, adding a burst of sweetness and a slight crunch that elevated the dish. A sprinkle of chili flakes added a mild heat, making each bite interesting and flavorful.

Combining these two dishes offered a wonderful variety of flavors and textures, making for a satisfying and well-rounded brunch. The ambiance of Bennie, with its large windows letting in natural light and the cozy yet stylish decor, made the experience even more enjoyable. The friendly and attentive staff ensured that my coffee cup was never empty and that the dining experience was seamless.

Overall, my brunch at Bennie Restaurant and Bar was delightful. The combination of Eggs Benedict and Avocado on Toast is highly recommended for those who want to enjoy the best of both worlds. Bennie‚Äôs inviting atmosphere and top-notch service make it a perfect spot for a relaxed and delicious brunch in London."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Our food was excellent and the presentation was super pretty. The restaurant is also a vibeee and we enjoyed dining in. Highly recommend.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,"Hasan was an exceptional waiter who made our visit truly enjoyable. From the moment we arrived, he greeted us with a warm smile and guided us to our table with genuine hospitality. Throughout the meal, he was attentive, polite, and knowledgeable about the menu, offering helpful suggestions without being pushy. The restaurant itself had a cozy and inviting atmosphere, with soft lighting, comfortable seating, and a pleasant buzz of conversation that made it perfect for a relaxed evening out. Hasan‚Äôs excellent service, combined with the welcoming vibe of the place, made for a memorable dining experience.
And of course the place was a nice and quiet one I felt relief eating there after a tired full busy day really appreciate it"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"The food here is DELICIOUS! First had wings and calamari, lovely!

Then for my mains I had ‚ÄòBraised Beef Short Rib‚Äô OMG, how tender and scrumptious was this, loved every bit of it.

I recommend this restaurant and thank you Wowcher for this great deal and for the excellent customer service. Will definitely be coming back here."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Love this place! Cosy stylish atmosphere, friendly staff, good service, tasty food and drinks üëèüèª"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Had an amazing time at Bennie for dinner! The food was amazing, very tasty and well presented. The staff were friendly and were happy to give us recommendations on cocktails and dishes. The atmosphere was perfect for a catch up with friends. Will definitely be back"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I had the pleasure of enjoying a late lunch at Bennie‚Äôs on Saturday, and it was an absolute delight from start to finish. Coincidentally, it was International Women‚Äôs Day and the restaurant added a truly thoughtful touch by presenting all the women dining there a beautiful white rose‚Äîa small but incredibly meaningful gesture that made the experience even more special.

From the moment I walked in, I was met with warm and welcoming service. The ambiance was simply brilliant‚Äîa perfect balance of sophisticated yet cozy, making it an ideal spot to unwind and enjoy a fantastic meal. Speaking of which, the food? Flawless. Every dish was prepared with precision, bursting with rich flavors and beautifully presented.

The service was attentive without being intrusive and the staff made sure every detail was just right. It‚Äôs rare to find a restaurant that nails ambiance, service and food all at once, but Bennie‚Äôs does it effortlessly.

I‚Äôm already looking forward to my next visit‚Äîthis is the kind of place that leaves a lasting impression. Highly recommend!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Fantastic full English breakfast!  Really good quality, at a very good price (by Central London standards)"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I recently dined at Bennie and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. Situated on a bustling street, Bennie radiates a cozy, inviting atmosphere that instantly relaxes you.

As I entered, I received a warm greeting from the hostess and was promptly seated. The interior struck a perfect balance of elegance and comfort, with soft lighting and tasteful decor creating a welcoming ambiance. The staff were remarkable throughout the evening ‚Äì attentive, friendly, and well-versed in the menu options.

The highlight of my visit was the apple strudel with ice cream. This dessert was a culinary delight, marrying the sweetness of the apples with a buttery, flaky pastry. Paired with the creamy ice cream, each bite was a heavenly experience. It wasn't just a dessert; it was a masterpiece of flavors and textures.

Overall, my visit to Bennie was nothing short of fantastic. The blend of excellent service, delightful ambiance, and exceptional cuisine made for an unforgettable dining experience. I highly recommend Bennie to anyone seeking a special night out or a place to celebrate an important occasion."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Amazing service! Will be back. Anastasia is as super attentive as well as the rest of the staff. Live music was great. Spasibo ü´∂üèΩ
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,"Came to Bennie's for my Dad & friend's birthday. Decent atmosphere & highly recommend their beef tartare. However, what let Bennie's down was the service being quite slow. When we ordered our drinks, it took quite a long time (about 20+ minutes) & our food came at different times leaving half of the group to start eating without the others, & the side plates for some of the food came afterwards which made it debatable to pay the service charge. But overall it was a decent experience, but for the money we paid it could've been better."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I stumbled upon this restaurant travelling with my parents. It's a 10-minute walk from Oxford Street. The interior is modern, and they serve food all day from breakfast to dinner.

üåü Salmon Tartare üí∞¬£12
üåü Chicken Skewer üí∞¬£9
üåü Charcuterie Board üí∞¬£11

Each dish was delicious! The salmon tartare was very fresh, with perfectly ripe avocado. The chicken thigh and chorizo skewers were tender and juicy, and the charcuterie board was a generous portion at a very reasonable price.

üåü Beef Ribs üí∞¬£29
üåü Beef Cheek üí∞¬£20
üåü Grilled Beef Salad üí∞¬£14.5

The portions of the three main dishes were incredibly large. The beef ribs were a bit dry, but the seasoning was great. The beef cheek was braised very tenderly and tasted fantastic! The salad featured tender grilled beef, and the mustard sauce was appetizing‚Äîhighly recommended!

üç∑ A pint of beer was ¬£6.5

Overall, it was very affordable! Considering the location and the ambiance, good value for money.

Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Visited on 13 April 2024 with the family for breakfast and would highly recommend. We had three full breakfasts and one eggs Benedict with mushroom, four drinks, and everything was excellent. It was fairly quiet when we went as it had just opened but can imagine its buzzing when busier. Will definitely visit again."

Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Lovely restaurant. Fantastic food. Attentive waitress. Beautiful atmosphere. Melt in the mouth steak. Good size portions.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Went for breakfast, the food is incredible, the bacon was just the right thickness and everything was beautifully presented. I also followed it with the cheesecake and oh wow, this is by far the best cheesecake I have ever eaten!! Incredible, will be coming back for more."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Good food, quick service. Nice brunch experience. The lighting and ambience are nice. We‚Äôll be back to try out the dinner"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,Food was well presented but a bit bland. Dessert was nice. Main problem was they charged us extra to use a QR code to pay and then asked us to tip on top of the service charge :(
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Super nice and calm place if you wanna get away from the noise of SOHO. Amazing food and drink. Highly recommended if you are in central london
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Excellent food and experience. A great spot that has thoughtfully prepared their menu. Had the pork belly and it was delicious. Well worth the visit!

we popped in for cocktails and had some lside dishes too.
Very clean and quick service
The decor is beautiful too"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Very tasty place! We ordered several starters and main courses. I really liked the roasted broccoli and baby potatoes, wow! I also recommend the duck. I've never eaten anything so tasty and juicy! And their riesling is very tasty!"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Lovely interior, reasonable prices and amazing food - the cheesecake in particular was to die for, it was by far the best one we‚Äôve ever tried! Very talented chefs, would highly recommend."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"A fresh feel to Great Portland Street, the decor in the restaurant is amazing and creates a very chilled but vibrant atmosphere. I had a light lunch with a friend of mine and the food was faultless (highly recommend eggs Benedict with pork belly) I am really looking forward to try out Bennies of an evening because the rest of the menu looked delicious! I would give a rating of 10 stars if I could."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Great service, very attentive. Cocktails great and food good and well presented and very nice."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,4.0,Surprisingly good to be fair. Don't be fooled by the poor visually looking menu as the food is great.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Perfect place!Had dinner on NYE!great music,great service and lots of smiling faces üôÇ a must visit"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Food and coffee were great.  Service and atmosphere were really good as well.  Definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,perfect birthday lunch!! really helpful staff and darina was amazing. lovely food definitely coming again !
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,We reserved a table for 11 people on New Year's Eve. Everything worked perfectly. The food tasted great and was served at the same time - so we could all eat together. The drinks service was just as quick and perfect. The price was also reasonable for London. We'd love to come back!
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I just visited yesterday for brunch to celebrate my 60 th birthday. The food was amazing, the waitress was amazing and so professional, the lovely birthday cake with Candle was a lovely touch and I would recommend this place as it‚Äôs excellent and a beautiful place xx"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,"Promising 3.
Would return to have cocktail and steal tar tar.
Lunch offer menu not offered, I had to ask.  It was then given - Not sure if it was genuinely forgotten or intentionally not given. Not asked about allergies/ intolerance but I understand this can be forgotten.
Either way, a bad start.

Steak tar tar 10/10, nor served straight from the fridge like in some establishments.
Aubergene was very good, not oiley or heavily battered.

Brocolli tempura was crispy around the stem. However, dissapointingly,  the floret sections were dense with dough.

Would prefer the immediate entrance area to be the white and green colour scheme to make it more daytime friendly as I wouldn't return to breakfast or lunch here in the summer months.
Good use of mirrors throughout and does pull off the orange colour scheme without connotations of Easy-Jet.

Payment is preferred via QR for which there is a ¬£1 at platform charge in addition to the 12.5 service free. You are then also offered to tip.
Seems unethical to me, as if paying in haste etc., one could easily add this. Would also like the option to remove service fee which can only be done through verbal request.

Presently would recommend it for evenings only.
There are 3 different fonts used on external signage.
The door handle when entering is too close to the other door that your knuckles are grazed.
Music is good and appropriate to the setting.

I will return for nightimg cocktails and to see if the mains will warrant the same praise as the starters.

If you like Ottolenghi you would like it here.
Will give the benefit of the doubt as i would like to believe there is honesty in the service here and that the lunch offer menu was genuinely forgotten.

Because of the brocolli I left feeling hungry. The redeeming feature was the steak tar tar"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"The most amazing eggs with pork belly in London, and I guess also in the world. Must try."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Friendly staff and delicious food. We had a great dinner here.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"An incredibly underrated gem of a restaurant, nice chill vibe and outstanding food and service - especially by the waitress Galina and bartender Vlad. Would highly recommend and will for sure be back."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,3.0,Went based on Google reviews but it was just OK. Strange menu and was very quiet on a Saturday night. Had pasta and parmesan not offered and then it took about 5 mins for it to come. Not sure why it had good rating. Portion size was quite small for the price. Also sweet potato chips on menu but they didn't have any
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,2.0,"Quite disappointing, sadly!

Brought 8 people for my birthday (notified in the booking) on Saturday 8th Feb. We did arrive 15 minutes late, although I called ahead to notify, which they said was absolutely fine. The restaurant was not busy (3 tables with 2-4 guests per table).

Minimal atmosphere, loud and cheesy cover pop song covers. Food wasn't quick and service was poor; no wine menus on the table with the other menus, then 4 given judiciously between 8(?). I asked for olive oil and balsamic vinegar to go with our bread, but they didn't come, saying they don't offer table olive oil or balsamic vinegar - how about on a plate? I asked for a burrata starter (which, while on the menu in other dishes, wasn't sold alone, so they declined that too). How hard is it to put a burrata on a plate with a little olive oil? Although well presented, the food was only okay in flavour. King prawns were great, but my monkfish was overcooked, and portion sizes were a little on the stingy side.

I eat out quite a bit, and really don't expect much, but when it's your birthday, you'd hope service would ensure it's at least going well? No happy birthday on arrival, no above and beyond? No problem, I just won't come again, sadly."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,4.0,"The starters and main courses were excellent, the desserts less so, especially the chocolate brownie which was so dry nobody could eat it.
The place is nice, not ideal for our group because there were too many of us and the restaurant is shaped so that people at different tables can't quite see each other, but for a smaller group would have been good.
I don't see it in the list but I had the mushroom burger and it was excellent."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"What a lovely experience! Great food and coffee, friendly staff and very nicely designed interior. Definitely coming back."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I had a great time in this little restaurant right in the heart of central London. The food was amazing from the start to finish.
Starters, steak and dessert were cooked to perfection."

Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Food was 1st class, service excellent and great value for money. Highly recommend"
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Just wanted to say bennie‚Äôs the best restaurant ever !!! I booked the private room for my birthday event last night and honestly it was so beautiful the staff were amazing they was very patient and catering to us . Would defo recommend here again and will definitely come back again. Thank you so much for making my birthday amazing !!!
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Great spot for some good food. Had the pan fried salmon and mushroom risotto.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,2.0,"We were sat by the door and of course as people come and go the cold air wafts in. Not a deal breaker but provides further explanation to the overall score.

Food was OK. I had the Beef tartar to start, tasted nice, looked nostalgic, which was fitting for the restaurant as it has a throwback feel. I had a prawn and crab pasta, which was a bit dry and I thought lacking in crab and just three king prawns. ¬£20.

Service was OK, nothing to praise or complain about. I don‚Äôt think I would return here."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Great food and really friendly and attentive service.

Thanks to Vlad and the team for a nice evening."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Recently visited this restaurant for a work lunch.
Service and food were top notch.
Will be returning."
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,Ambiance and restaurant is amazing! Went here today with my friend. I really loved the food. We had dine in for brunch. Very friendly staff. We gave a her a tip because she is so nice.
Bennie Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Cocktail, prawns and beef tar tar was yummy. Nice, beautiful and calm place. Staff is welcome"
Piccolino Exchange Square,16.0,Óóä
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We had the beef lasagna and beef ragu, it is one of the best ones we have ever had! It‚Äôs full of flavour, soft and melts in your mouth. I could come here every day for the lasagna, it has a truffle flavour, homemade pasta! We have been twice now and will be coming back! Lovely location and excellent service. Thank you!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"This is my second time have been here and I decided to leave a 5 stars review.

The restaurant it‚Äôs pretty, really good for special occasions especially and they have friendly staff to serve you the best food. I ordered crab meat ravioli this time, and the sauce was quite unique which add an extra point to the dish. Surprisingly the portion was bigger than I thought !!

I had good food and experience for the both time I went !"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Piccolo Exchange is one of those rare places that instantly makes you feel both welcome and intrigued. The food is creative, beautifully presented, and full of flavor this is truly something special.

A real highlight of the evening was the pistachio tuile: paper-thin, nutty, with just the right hint of sweetness and a touch of berry glaze. It‚Äôs the kind of thoughtful detail that sums up the whole experience.

Special mention to Fadil our server who made the night even better. Warm, knowledgeable and effortlessly attentive - he brought a personal touch that made us feel genuinely cared for.

Whether you‚Äôre there for a cozy dinner or a celebration, Piccolo Exchange offers something memorable. Highly recommended!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"The drinks were really good - my mocktail was not too sweet and great flavor. The food was all decently good flavor, I think the presentation can be better. The dessert was ok - could be that my expectations were too high as the Tiramisu was highly recommended by people. In general, very pleasant dinning experience."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We went to Piccolino just for a drink, but the place was so nice we decided to stay for dinner‚Äîand we‚Äôre glad we did! The atmosphere was really welcoming, the drinks were great, and the food was delicious. The staff were friendly and made us feel right at home. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"I came here the first time and was served a very salty carbonara that was not to the standard i keep this restaurant at. After making a review about my experience, i was approached by their team in Google and they asked me to give them a second chance, assuring that this was a one-time occurrence.
I had a conversation with the manager over the phone and we agreed on another day.
I went there today and was left nothing but happy.
The carbonara came perfectly salty and it tasted even better with their house wine.
Will definitely be back.

The first picture is from the first time and the second picture from today."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Absolutely loved the experience at Piccolino Exchange Square! The atmosphere is elegant yet welcoming, perfect for a relaxed lunch or a classy evening out. The service was top-notch attentive without being intrusive. I had the seafood linguine and it was bursting with flavor, perfectly cooked. The wine selection is impressive too, with great pairing recommendations from the staff. Definitely one of the best Italian dining spots in Manchester. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"If you are looking for exceptional service, great food and an amazing vibe then this is definitely one to visit. I‚Äôve been a regular for many years and cannot recommend highly enough! Fadil is also a great new addition to the team!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"The prawn starters were amazing, the main courses were standard. Service and atmosphere is really good, if you are around good spot to grab dinner.."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We had an absolutely incredible experience at Piccolino Liverpool Street! From the moment we arrived, the service was exceptional. Serena the hostess she was very welcoming, Fabio, the restaurant manager, made us feel so welcome, ensuring that every detail of our visit was perfect.

At the bar, Maurizio prepared some of the best cocktails we've ever had ‚Äî his recommendations were spot on and added a special touch to our evening.

And the food ‚Äî simply outstanding! Every dish was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and bursting with flavor. You can tell how much passion and skill goes into his cooking ‚Äî it made our dining experience unforgettable.

If you're looking for a place that combines fantastic food, outstanding service, and a warm atmosphere, Piccolino Liverpool Street is the place to go. We can't wait to return!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"What I liked most about the restaurant that we were not rushed to order or to leave. We ended up spending 3 hours, sat outside on a wonderful summer warm day. A table was booked in advance, but there were lots of tables available indoors. We were served by very friendly staff. The food is good and options for vegetarians are available. Prices are London prices, so expect to pay ¬£70 each for mains and drinks."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"The food is delicious, the staff are wonderful, and if you let them, they're really funny and will interact with your table making your meal a wonderful experience.

To get here from Liverpool St Station, follow the escalator to the upper concourse towards the bus station, past the M&S, tanning salon and Moshi Moshi and the down Sun Terrace up to Exchange Plaza. It can be a bit difficult to find otherwise (not the restaurant's fault)."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"An amazing hidden gem of a location and venue for corporate events, social gatherings and even family dining.

A little tricky to find via Google maps but if you head towards the back end of Liverpool Street station (facing the platforms, walk on the upper mezzanine level) you will soon see exchange square.

The restaurant has a lovely private dining room overlooking the main restaurant which I am using for a corporate dinner.

Highly recommended beautifully decorated Italian restaurant well worth a visit."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Domenico was an amazing waiter and bartender! Not only was he incredibly attentive and professional, but he also made our experience so much fun with his great sense of humor. He gave excellent recommendations and really went above and beyond to ensure we had a fantastic time. Highly recommend asking for him‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,2.0,"Came here with the Club IR 50% off offer - otherwise the prices are very high for what it is.

I was very disappointed with the arancini (it was almost cold), and the other dishes were only average.

The staff really very attentive though and it‚Äôs a very large space."
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"The location was stunning and general service was good. However, the waiter at our table was not attentive and rather abrupt, we found the food poor value for money and there was no gluten free pizza despite the menu stating there was. Disappointing I‚Äôm afraid so I would not recommend it."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Piccolini Exchange Square last night.

I ordered the Caesar salad ‚Äì not the most traditional Italian choice, I know ‚Äì but it was excellent. Unlike most places, their version came generously topped with chicken, which made it feel like a proper meal rather than just a starter.

We sat outside to enjoy the surrounding garden seating area, even though it is in the middle of a building complex the incredible planting makes it feel like you are somewhere else! As the evening cooled down, we moved under the heated seating area. It was a really nice touch to be able to stay warm while still enjoying the outdoor setting. Dessert was the perfect finish ‚Äì the pistachio panna cotta was absolutely incredible.

A special mention to the waiting staff, all of whom were friendly and attentive. One gentleman in particular ‚Äì dark hair and what sounded like a strong Italian accent ‚Äì was especially helpful and made us feel very well looked after.

All in all, a brilliant evening. I‚Äôm already looking forward to visiting the new Tower Bridge location soon!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Piccolino is a great place to eat and drink. The food is fresh, tasty, and well made, with lots of classic Italian dishes. The drinks, including cocktails and wine, go really well with the food. It‚Äôs a nice place to relax and enjoy a good meal."
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"It's a pleasant restaurant situated in a very busy area of the city hence the prices are far higher than the quality of the food.

Ordered the pork arincini balls for starters which was faultless. Ordered the Branzino fish for my main which I thought was a small portion. Nevertheless it was filling and it tasted good. It did some with chips and some boiled veg which were nothing amazing.  One of my friends ordered the mushroom risotto which they were happy with.

For dessert ordered the chocolate ganache which was very good. I would recommend a visit but be wary of the price."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Had a private dining experience. The fish was amazing and the other food, steaks, vegetarian options starters and desserts all looked amazing great feedback. Tiramisu was epic and prosecco went down a treat"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"üìù Mixed feelings about this Italian restaurant that partly disappointed expectations after seeing such good ratings. Prices were acceptable though.

üç¥ Food I tried was ok, even pretty good I'd say, not mindblowing. I had some antipasti, fish with side veggies and budino di panettone for dessert: no complaints with anything I had. Tasted well. The lobster pasta my colleagues had didn't look great to be honest which they confirmed after eating it.

üìç It's located close to Liverpool Street station. Decor was ok, kind of modern. The music was a bit loud... at the limit to allow a group conversation at the table.

‚òùüèº Service wasn't good enough: they were polite but for instance nobody cleaned the table before serving dessert... really not great."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We chose this restaurant to celebrate our friend birthday. We had such a great time. Food was delicious and service even better. We set outside and they looked after us without being intrusive. Great suggestions and the tramis√π was so authentic. We had mainly wine, but cocktails also were great. Fadil, our server gave us the best service we could ask, attentive and professional. Highly raccomended. Will be back soon."
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"Poor service without a smile, and extremely rude bar staff. Came here for a Christmas work lunch, and the unseasoned steak (which I paid extra for) was a very poor cut of meat; half of it was gristle. Chips were soggy and vegetables burnt. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Spent some great time there.. the food was pretty good but what I liked the most was the staff who really took care of you.. very friendly and polite. The steak could have been a little better but the dessert more than made up for it!
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Great Italian restaurant located in Exchange Square (just behind Liverpool Street Station). Staff were attentive and friendly.

Huge menu with a great selection of pastas. Opted for the Scallops for starter, Ravioli for main, and the Nutella tart for dessert. All cooked and presented well."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"One of the best Italians in London!
Authentic Italian cuisine at its best: absolute delicious food and extraordinary service - highly recommend and will definitely be back"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Great food and service. Fairly quiet on a Friday lunchtime, but that's central London these days.  The food was excellent, as was the service. I will definitely go back"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Been here before and decided to go again for our anniversary on Wednesday early evening. Had a few different dishes. All were delicious!! Will find another excuse to go back very soon. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food came pretty quickly which is always good.
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Nice spaghetti carbonara. Negroni was okay. Calamari was just okay, nice sauce though. Good cocktails. Coffee and ice cream desserts are a must. My highlight of the night
Decent place for a quick lunch or quick pre theatre meal as close to the station"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Had the fried calamari, vegan margherita and frutti di bosco for dessert. Service was attentive and respectful, glasses never ran empty and we weren't left waiting long for food at all. Excellent variety of quality wines to choose from.

Venue was exceptionally clean and very spacious with a comfortable outdoor seating area letting you enjoy a quiet space surrounded by the towering London skyline.

Only downside was the disappointing lack of good dairy free main courses. My pizza came with no dairy-free cheese replacement, they just removed the cheese from my food. Starter and desert were stellar on the other hand."
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,Really nice experience here midweek for work dinner for 16 people. Staff were really attentive. Relatively pricey food however the food was exceptional with many options. DJ in the bar area was nice however for the restaurant area it was quite loud. Would revisit as there are more dishes I need to try!
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,The beef shin ravioli and malbec wine was absolutely delicious. The service and vibes are very very nice. Good date spot or place to catch up with friends. Talal was our waiter and he was super lovely and attentive.
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"A big shout out to this place and the extra customer care they showed me this week.  I was there for drinks with customers before a dinner reservation but unfortunately forgot my card, which was behind the bar and of course this meant I had not paid either.  I called and spoke to the bar the following day to apologise and arrange payment and a colleague to stop by to pick up, however they insisted on posting the card back to me with the receipt from transaction too.  The following day, the card arrived special delivery at cost of ¬£10 to them, which I thought was amazing and very kind service.  I most certainly will head there when visiting same customer again.  Thank you team."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,I like this bar/restaurant. The food is good and during good weather you can eat outdoors. It's worth visiting if in the area.
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Popped in for dinner as they had a 50% off deal for members with the app. Service was great, staff were very attentive and food was brought out on time. I would say the food was hit and miss, some of us ordered the same dishes on the table and the portion sizes were a little mismatched which wasn‚Äôt great. The pasta dishes didn‚Äôt seem authentic at all, a lot of ‚Äúcream‚Äù added to most of them. I had the livers to start and the duck as a main which were both lovely, however the duck had a fair bit of gristle which put me off from finishing the meal. I would recommend this place for a catchup with friends or colleagues if the offer is still on but wouldn‚Äôt personally pay full price for what‚Äôs on offer."
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,Although the meal and the staff were pleasant enough. When a mouse emerged from the kitchen and ran across the restaurant and the staff did nothing apart from tell us thats what happens in London. Would not recommend unless you love mice.
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Food was nice, well seasoned, portions were however a little small. Service was average, long wait take the initial order could be more attentive."
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"Absolutely disgusting
Food is terrible
Paid ¬£70 in total, the starter was taken away before finished, the main was meant to be chicken, and bacon ceaser salad, well,  it was the worst salad I've ever had. Tried getting a table of 10 to pay upfront - including service charge before having a drink and food. Unbelievable, I would never ever return to this place. Shame, as the music is good and the restaurant looks really nice but the food is barely edible, and for the price disgusting!!!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Enjoyed my meal here. The waiter was really lovely. The bar was a bit weird though, it turned out that they gave the waiter a different bottle of wine to the one we ordered without telling us and then charged us for that on the bill... well they changed it in the end after we mentioned it, but it's a good idea to check the bill before paying here. Food was cooked well, prawns and langoustines were tasty."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"My first trip to London with my daughter and I was browsing Italian restaurants. I realized Piccolino from Harrogate (favorite restaurant) was right here near Shoreditch. I knew the menu would be amazing and the service would be top notch. Fadil was the best! Super attentive, great service! Piccolino is my favorite restaurant in the whole world and that‚Äôs coming from a NYer."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We went on a Tuesday around 5pm. It was quiet so had a drink at the bar before moving to the restaurant.  We ordered 2 x 25 layer lasagnes which I know is always excellent.  Unfortunately mine came out flat and looked unloved. They made us two news ones which were fabulous and didn't charge us for either.  They also gave us some Lemonicni to clear out pallets.
Service was impeccable and the atmosphere grew to quiet to cheery as the evening went on.  Loved every minute and we were looked after brilliantly. Probably the best Italian in the city!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,2.0,"I came for a bottomless brunch on the 8th of February as part of a friends 21st birthday. There was about 9 of us. This was the most awful experience i‚Äôve ever had at a bottomless brunch. The food was horrendous, cold and bland. I had the pizza and it wasn‚Äôt at all how it was described. The drinks top up rarely came round considered it was a ¬£60 brunch each and ¬£45 service charge altogether for the table. The service for drinks was disgraceful, I on several occasions had to go up to servers and ask them to refill our drinks. Their attitude was poor and there was a complete lack of customer service. Although the music was good. I wouldn‚Äôt come here again and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend it."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"The best dirty martini I‚Äôve ever had!! Amazing service, fast and efficient. Dom the manager, very knowledgable and welcoming! Will be coming back!!!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,Quality of food was ok. Very very slow service. I think you need to work on the speed of service during lunch time for the people who work in the city.
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"On a positive note our initial booking was for 2pm but due to train cancellations we were delayed- we contacted the restaurant to let them know and they honoured our booking for when we actually arrived. In hindsight I'd rather they hadn't, which would have saved us the effort.
It was pretty downhill from there. We travelled over an hour to London especially for this brunch... after the experience we had, I won't be rushing back.
On arrival we were given the bill to pay the remaining ticket fee before receiving our first drinks.Included in this bill was a ¬£35 service charge. I'm not opposed to paying a service charge at all, after I've experienced the service (if its been good). I politely asked for the 'optional' service charge to be removed for this payment, ensuring we will tip at the end if we see fit but this was met with a challenging attitude and took multiple back and forths
before the waiter accepted. They then proceeded to bring an incorrect round of drinks to our table.
Not a great start.
The food was nice enough, but table service was mediocre. None of our starter plates were cleared before our mains dumped on the table, making it very overcrowded. I had ordered an extra side of zucchini chips, which I paid a service charge for, only to later realise I never actually received them so can't comment if they were any good!
We also didn't receive our full time of bottomless drinks, were quite rudely told our time is up without any pre warning, then shortly after were told to leave and more or less chased off the premises as it was turning back into a normal restaurant. I understand there are set times, but this was around 5:40 when the event said until 6. We aren't rowdy girls either, at this point we were just sat at our table chatting as we could finally hear each other due to the music changing.
Atmosphere wise the music was good but so incredibly loud it was hard to hear the friend next to me during the bottomless. Definitely not the place to go for a well needed catch up over dinner and drinks.
I wouldn't usually bother with reviews but as far as my expectations for an event in London are concerned, this was all very disappointing. After looking through other reviews I see a lot of issues in common with past service."
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,Great place just around Liverpool Street station. Service could be more friendly and attentive.
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Wow, that's all I can say! I came here with colleagues for a pre Christmas social event and the team did not disappoint.

They were courteous from the door and throughout our entire time at the restaurant. The food was lovely - starter, main and dessert! Oh, the mocktail ""Tropic Like It's Hot"" was fantastic. Not a drop of ice to water down the drink - just the way it should be!

Our food orders were placed on place cards, so no one forgot their order on the night.  The team kept checking we were enjoying our meals. They catered to some colleagues who were vegetarian/vegan and catered to their needs as best as possible.

A lovely evening was had by all, and would recommend!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,We had chicken breast with goonki it was absolutely beautiful. The pizza was average. The house ros√© wine was lovely. It was fresh and fruity. I like the atmosphere with  the mint color interior. The vibe was lively and the staff were friendly
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Had great service from Talal - kept the aperols coming!! Coming back here for my birthday celebrations end of May!

Thank you so much - Holly & Clare"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Business lunche for 16 so a large group. Nice atmosphere, very clean. However the layout is such that the waiting staff have to lean over to adjust utensils and serve the food and drinks. Good menu selection, but none of us came away saying ""that was nice"". Actually the conversation was, ""did they turn the temperature down to get us to leave""? We could/should have eaten in the company canteen, our host from AWS wanted to treat us, same...."
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,Visited here for a team dinner. The chicken pasta was average as were the desserts. The tiramisu was the only standout item on the menu. Service can also use some work as we had to wait several minutes between any time from the staff visited our table
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Piccolino in Exchange Square, and it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. The ambiance is charming, offering a perfect blend of elegance and comfort. However, what truly made our evening memorable was the exceptional service provided by our server, Mary.

From the moment we were seated, Mary was incredibly attentive, ensuring that every detail of our meal was perfect. Her warm and friendly demeanor made us feel welcome and valued as guests. She had an excellent knowledge of the menu and offered fantastic recommendations that made our dining experience even more delightful.

Mary was always available when we needed her, yet never intrusive, striking the perfect balance in customer service. Her attentiveness and genuine care for our satisfaction truly set her apart.

The food, as always at Piccolino, was delicious and beautifully presented. Each dish was a testament to the culinary expertise of the kitchen staff. But it was Mary's exemplary service that elevated our visit from a great meal to an unforgettable evening.

If you're looking for a dining experience where you'll be treated with utmost care and enjoy wonderful food, I highly recommend Piccolino in Exchange Square. And if you're lucky enough to have Mary as your server, you're in for an exceptional treat. Thank you, Mary, for making our night special!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"Typical italian, rude staff and very average to low food.

Soon to be closed i think.

Managers unbelievably rude and arrogant.

Not recommend"
Piccolino Exchange Square,1.0,"My daughter has just been to this venue for her birthday for a bottomless brunch, they had to pay upfront and have been served only two drinks in an hour!! Then had the cheek to try charge them ¬£70 service charge. Clearly the staff have seen a young group of girls as an easy target for money. Disgusting"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Great atmosphere and attentive staff! Food was great too.
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Good food good a presentation, beautiful restaurant, staff as always great service"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Really cosy place to get drinks after work in a hidden leafy garden tucked behind Liverpool st station. Escape the rush, chill in the cosy al fresco seating. Especially enjoyed the non alcoholic cocktails which were only ¬£5. Will definitely be back! Great customer service too."
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Lovely location, nice staff, just on the pricier end for fairly simple food (pizzas/pasta etc). We did all however enjoy our food and I would go back. The courgette fries were amazing, the dessert though was too rich, even between 4 we didn't finish it (and we like sweet stuff!)"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Talal looked after us today and his service was amazing, he looked after us and made sure we had everything we needed ! Will definitely be coming back !!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"I want to say thank you very much for saving my birthday! I booked a table at another establishment and everything was very bad, we left after 5 minutes of being there. When we arrived at this establishment, we were greeted very warmly. The hostess was very friendly, the manager was simply magical, the waiters and runners were simply wonderful. I want to say a special thank you to Andrea and Angelo (I'm not sure I spelled their names correctly, sorry), they were absolutely wonderful. I definitely recommend this place to everyone! Thank you very much to the whole team, I am very grateful for this evening!!!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,4.0,"Went here for a Birthday and had a fantastic time great food options along with good drinks service, the atmosphere was amazing and got everyone up dancing.

Would highly recommend for a girls brunch or mixed gender groups.

Would definitely go again."
Piccolino Exchange Square,2.0,"Food  was just ok and not as good as the one at Manchester.  The food was served quite slow and we could see the calamari was on the kitchen table for more than 10 minutes before being served to us.  Also, we did put Birthday on my booking but nothing happened and the staff didn‚Äôt serve us the birthday plate at all, which was very disappointing and we didn‚Äôt expect this from a restaurant at this level."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Good food and even more amazing and thoughtful service from our waiter Talal who made a birthday dinner very special.
Piccolino Exchange Square,2.0,"The food was barely average, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend‚Ä¶ but the terrace is quite nice"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Ok, but not impressed. Cosy atmosphere and caring stuff. Probably perfect for a business lunch, but ¬£20 for a main is a bit of an overkill for the quality you get."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We celebrated my best friend birth and we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better atmosphere! We had the best time with delicious food, amazing Prosecco and had an excellent service from all the time! A special thank you to Alessia for taking care of us girls so well, to Luigi the general manager, Nadia, Fabio, Maurizio and the Napolitan waiter. I am looking forward to coming back here soon!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"Came in for a business lunch. There was ample space, and the setting is pleasant. Staff were nice.
The menu is broad. Food was tasty. I would say that it is expensive, for what it is. Now that I read other reviews, it seems that a 50% discount is often used. This would have been great!
My main concern was regarding the service. We were simply abandoned towards the end of the meal - a dessert menu was provided, but nobody came to ask if we actually wanted dessert or coffee. I eventually wanted to pay the bill and get back to the office, but no amount of sticking my head up was enough to garner attention."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Great food, good portion size. The service was out of this world. Super Friendly, my glass was never empty!"
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Came here for a friends birthday and it was a lovely time. The food was great, had the calamari, rag√∫ and chocolate fondant - drinks were also lovely. The staff were extremely attentive - service was really great. Our waiter tamal was excellent as well. Would highly recommend."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,The atmosphere was absolutely fantastic. The staff were very friendly and attentive considering how busy it was in there.. Dom the manager was amazing.. Thank you for a such a wonderful evening.  Would  definitely visit Piccolino again.
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,Talal was an excellent waiter and we absolutely loved the brunch. Really friendly staff!
Piccolino Exchange Square,3.0,"I'm sorry but I was disappointed with my food at lunchtime today - the bottle of wine was lovely, the service and atmosphere were great, but the food was very lack lustre.  It was my birthday lunch, and I had salmon tagliatelle.  Well, there was very little salmon and asparagus, but nearly a whole pack of peas!  Very poor and I now have stomach ache after so many peas.  Also, the portions my friends had were very on the small side - mushroom gnocchi and beef tortelloni.  Not only that the online prices were much lower than the actual menu.   I have had far better in the locality."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"My family and I (5 of us) have started coming here every Christmas to kick off the festivities (this is the 2nd year).  This year was absolutely incredible and Dom and Talal made all of our Christmas' already with the service they provided throughout the evening.

While they had sold out of some of the items on the menu, they made sure to make up for it and went above and beyond to ensure we went away happy, from complimentary prosecco to a complimentary dessert platter to share, we left speechless and eager to go back again!  (No Karen's were made, may I point out!).

London is a big place so we considered trying a different restaurant, but it's safe to say we'll be coming back every year, come rain or shine!

Thank you again to Dom & Talal for a wonderful evening that we'll be talking about for years.

Piccolino also always listen to my notes when booking, and make sure we get a comfortable/accessible spot to accommodate my disabled partner."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"We wanted to enjoy the sun on a December day and have a coffee outside. I‚Äôm glad Piccolino offers tables outside with big tents to cover the garden area, also heaters. There were no other place at the time to seat outside apart feom pubs. We didn‚Äôt have any food but service was spot on."
Piccolino Exchange Square,5.0,"Very good experience.
Maurizio is the must perfect person to have to service you."
HIDE,4.0,"The food was excellent ‚Äî fresh flavors, beautifully balanced, and presented with a clean, refined aesthetic. Each dish reflected great attention to detail in execution.

Unfortunately, the service fell short of the same standard. While the plates spoke for themselves, the experience was let down when our waiter began walking away midway through explaining a dish. It disrupted the flow and diminished what should have been a polished, engaging moment.

Overall, the cooking deserves recognition, but service consistency needs to match the quality coming out of the kitchen for the experience to truly shine."
HIDE,4.0,"We celebrated an anniversary at Hide, and were lucky enough to have received a gift voucher to use for dinner. We decided on the tasting menu which was divine. The service was mostly fantastic, and we enjoyed the special experience as a whole.

We weren‚Äôt given a wine list to ascertain prices or review what we might like to drink. We were basically just asked what we like, and could‚Äôve been given ¬£¬£¬£ wines by the glass. I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with this and it felt like a fuss to ask for the menu.

The music was not a vibe and I often found it too loud. It was like classic hits and pop songs rather than an ambient, elegant restaurant playlist which I feel would be better.

The signature dessert let the entire menu down. It‚Äôs beautiful being modelled on the staircase, but the dominant banana flavour I really didn‚Äôt enjoy, and I didn‚Äôt finish it.

Overall, we did love the dinner but there were a few details that let some parts down."
HIDE,3.0,"Difficult to assess. We were told initially we were going to be upstairs, but we were sat downstairs. Very busy venue with lots of groups some quieter than others. We went for breakfast and I am a huge fan of cooked breakfasts. The ‚Äúfry up‚Äù was a very small mushroom, one unexciting sausage of no great flavour and two small rashers of streaky bacon and half a large tomato with a thick central core. The food was reasonably free of too much grease, but not overly flavoursome, sadly a nice but underwhelming breakfast, not least for the price. At ¬£30 one expects great textured flavour rich sausages. Eggs were just ages nicely cooked but not much more to say. Staff were lovely breakfast was ok. My sourdough toast was good and my daughter was thrilled with her huge croissant with a number of choices of spreads and jams. Is it interesting? Yes, was it the sort of meal I would expect to see at a one Michelin starred venue not really"
HIDE,5.0,"Went here for our anniversary dinner and had the tasting menu which was wonderful.
I wanted to especially mention our server Chloe - she was incredible. She made our evening so special and she took special care with the dietary requirements as I was pregnant. She really is a credit to this restaurant.
Chloe - if you‚Äôre reading this, you were right - we had a girl! :)"
HIDE,5.0,"‚≠êÔ∏è5 stars ‚Äì One of London‚Äôs finest, consistently exceptional.

Took my best friend here for a treat and had the tasting menu, absolutely incredible. Every dish was refined, refreshing, and packed with thoughtful flavours. It‚Äôs the kind of food you simply can‚Äôt replicate at home, which makes the experience feel special.

The portions were just right: satisfying without being overwhelming. Service was polished, friendly, and perfectly paced. You leave feeling well looked after, not overly full or rushed.

This spot has been holding the bar high for years and still delivers every single time. A true favourite. 10/10."
HIDE,5.0,"The unusual menu format drew me to Hide but I found the whole experience surpassed my expectations and was far better than the foamy fare of standard Michelin Star places. The rotation of charming service staff with each dish was a nice touch to sync in with the variety of the courses. Our favorite course was the Not A Bread but it was one of many stand outs. Ambience, design and music also all excellent. Wine pairing was mixed and didn't stand out. Would benefit from more unusual offerings complimenting the menu style."
HIDE,4.0,"It was still a wonderful dining experience but felt a little different this time due to the recent change of chef and menu. Service is good - warm and professional, and nothing is overlooked from start to end. The updated menu is quite intriguing. A couple of dishes stand out, strong getting wowed of the truffle tart. Even so, we were sad to not see some hits from the previous repeats and overall flavour profile felt a bit less bold. It is still one of the finest dinning places in the surrounding area. Eager to see how the new chef will take the culinary directions further."
HIDE,5.0,"I‚Äôll save you time- book reservations here now. Hands down the best breakfast experience I‚Äôve ever had. I especially loved the small menu of rare and fine coffees, which were all absolutely delicious with unexpected flavors. The porridge, granola, black truffle, scrambled eggs, and croque monsieur were all absolutely exceptional. To top everything off, the sleek and organic design aesthetic adds to your experience as well as the great customer service. I highly recommend and hope I can return soon!"
HIDE,3.0,"My friend and I had the tasting menu. Food was nice. The first few snacks were amazing in terms of variety and presentation, but it went downhill as we moved to the fish and lamb courses. They were still nice but not memorable, really. The restaurant was so dark at that point that we almost had to blind test our taste buds, the experience which I didn't enjoy as much. Colour vibrancy was essential to me, especially at over ¬£200 price point without alcoholic consumption. Service was lacking. The sever didn't place cutlery gently or with precision. The restaurant didn't give me a fine dining setting anyway. Explanation of the dishes was not clear, and adding on top of the lack of visual presentation in the dark, I could hardly tell which was which. The oak staircase was great. The water tank-like glass facade facing the buzz of the city was controversial at ground level though."
HIDE,5.0,"Tucked away from central London‚Äôs chaos, this must-visit spot offers a truly memorable dining experience. The serene, picturesque setting and unique aesthetics transport you far from the city the moment you arrive.

Service is top-tier; warm, thoughtful, and attentive. During a special occasion, the staff quietly offered a better table when one opened up, making the time there even more special.

The curated menu balances creativity with comfort, with each dish feeling purposeful and refined.

Perfect for celebrations or quiet escapes, this restaurant is a rare find, charming, calming, and unforgettable."
HIDE,4.0,"The service? Outstanding! The interior design? Amazing.
The food was also very good, but I have to say, the buckwheat dish (and that's the only dish I can give an opinion on) was a tad bit too acidic. Instead of raw onions, caramelised ones would give a bit of sweetness and a bit crisp, I suppose. Great quality nevertheless, and the service was amazing, very kind people. In general, more on the expensive side, but the interior design alone is worth paying a visit. Very earthy.
The tea was also very good (could be a bit stronger, though (French Blue)."
HIDE,4.0,"Service was outstanding. Immaculately presented food. The flavour profile of the dishes left me wanting, just a little bit; not quite as balanced as I would have hoped for, considering the price. Outstanding in catering for dietary requirements."
HIDE,5.0,"We booked a breakfast reservation at Hide, and it exceeded all our expectations! This one Michelin star restaurant offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but the breakfast alone is worth the visit. We were seated promptly, and the ambiance was elegant with a unique woody and quirky charm. Don‚Äôt miss the stunning spiral staircase‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect for a photo op. They offer a great selection of specialty coffees and beans; my iced coffee was excellent. The standout for me was the granola yogurt‚Äîit was absolutely fantastic. Highly recommend this spot for a refined and memorable breakfast experience!"
HIDE,5.0,"Nice breakfast experience. A bit on the pricy side but you pay for the place and location. Brioche bread on the toast and scrambled eggs a bit dry, but nothing a good spoon of butter can‚Äôt fix."
HIDE,4.0,"Nice venue, good service. My main course was a rabbit lasagna (¬£8 supplement and not really worth it as it was very small for what you get).

Americano charged at ¬£6.50 and you don‚Äôt even get a small biscuit or chocolate- a rip off for a coffee.

Compared to other restaurants, I found the venue on the overprice side  for what you get."
HIDE,5.0,Breakfast at Hide during the Pride parade - booked it via a phone call as there was no more availability for the time we wanted online - window seat to watch the parade - Magic.  Everything we ordered was seriously good.  The seasonal Danish was AMAZING. Strawberry and tonka bean - who knew?
HIDE,4.0,"I had a really nice lunch at HIDE the other day. The lunch menu is pretty well priced and comes with a starter, main, and dessert. The oyster tempura was definitely my favourite. The dessert is not as good as the mains unfortunately.

The service however could have been better - the staff were a bit cold, and it didn‚Äôt really have the attentiveness you‚Äôd expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant."
HIDE,4.0,"Had a lovely dinner at Hide, invited by a business partner. The food was creative and tasty with a very cohesive menu. The service was friendly, and our glasses were always full. The cocktail prices are quite reasonable, I'd be gladly back to have their tasting menu. Highlights for me were the amazing breads and the mushroom broth!"
HIDE,5.0,"I had an unforgettable lunch experience at Hide. From the moment I walked in, the service was impeccable ‚Äî warm, professional, and perfectly in line with Michelin standards. The lunch set menu was beautifully curated, offering refined flavors, artistic presentation, and thoughtful balance in every course. The ambiance was elegant yet relaxed, allowing me to fully enjoy each dish in comfort. Every detail, from the freshly baked bread to the final petit fours, reflected a high level of care and craftsmanship. I highly recommend Hide for anyone looking for an exceptional fine dining experience in London."
HIDE,5.0,"My first birthday celebration in London with a beautiful soul who is really thoughtful. It was a bit surprise for me as I just mentioned the name of the restaurant randomly.‚ô•Ô∏è

Thank you so much for the wonderful experience. I enjoyed the dishes we ordered and the special cards with the little candle ~ it was such a joyful moment.

I am not a wine drinker but I quite enjoyed drinking the red wine here üç∑ and it didn‚Äôt make my face red at all.

‚Ä¢ Ambiance: 5/5
‚Ä¢ Service: 5/5 ‚Äî attentive without being pushy
‚Ä¢ Food: 5/5 ‚Äî full of rich, flavorful taste
‚Ä¢ Company: 6/5

Highly recommend for a ‚≠êÔ∏è star-level dining experience or celebrating special events!"
HIDE,4.0,"Really striking restaurant- light and airy and the seating was incredibly comfortable
We were there for Sunday lunch - each course was well made and tasty - everyone enjoyed their dishes.
The stand out was the rabbit lasagne - would come back for they alone.
The desserts which are typically my favourite course were too sweet and rich with no relief or something to cut through the sugar
Would def come back to have dinner
The only let down for us was the service - unfortunately our waitress was not the nicest coming across as quite curt - asking for anything eg the drinks menu etc seemed to be a hassle for her which dampened our experience"
HIDE,4.0,"Little disappointed from this over hyped restaurant.

The setting is beautiful, the staircase is a showstopper, staff are welcoming and professional.

Attention to detail is lacking, my water glass smelled like egg (it was replaced, but should not have been at the table), sugar bowl was chipped and for a restaurant of this calibre should not have been placed at the table.

Croque monsieur was delicious but the crust was hard to cut or bite into.

The Florentine eggs were very slightly undercooked as you had the gelatinous white. The spinach was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.

For the famous banana and pecan croissant and French toast, what a disappointment.
Both lacked in taste, very soggy and uninteresting.

This was not my first nor will it be  my last time the place is beautiful, staff are lovely and I'm sure there is plenty of other dishes to try."
HIDE,5.0,"Breakfast here was such a vibe. We had the Full English, truffle scrambled eggs on toast, egg Benedict and blueberry toast. I highly recommend the blueberry toast, however the only thing that wasn‚Äôt to my taste was the Thai coffee. Being Thai myself I should‚Äôve known! Really looking forward to my next visit here."
HIDE,5.0,"Exceptional food, beautiful decor, fantastic ambience and perfect service.
Having visited a few times now I have never had a bad experience at Hide.
There is something for everyone on the menu and no dish will disappoint you, particular highlights being the softshell crab, bread basket (absolute must) and the potato cakes. All of the steaks are high quality meat cooked to perfection.
The staff are plentiful and extremely attentive but without feeling overbearing. They're always there when you need them but unlike some establishments they aren't constantly interrupting you. The sommelier team and the selection of wines behind them are the icing on the cake to the brilliant food.
From full meals, to snacks to drinks in the bar downstairs you will never be disappointed here."
HIDE,5.0,"This place was beyond my expectations. Appart from the amazing service, the food was delicious. Everything, from the bread at the start to the desert at the end was perfect. I enjoyed every moment of it. Now the place itself ‚Ä¶ simply gorgeous. The stair is actually made from one single tree. When you go there, visit the private rooms downstairs (if they are empty). Each one of them is decorated with a theme. I would recommended a hundreds times !!!"
HIDE,5.0,"The service was exceptional, the ambiance was beautiful, and the atmosphere was just perfect. The food? Absolutely unforgettable - the best breakfast I‚Äôve ever had! Whatever you do, don‚Äôt skip the soaked pistachio orange bun, it was pure perfection. Words can‚Äôt truly capture how amazing this experience was, so just go and see for yourself!"
HIDE,4.0,"We had a nice breakfast experience here overall. The free cloakroom was a nice touch as we entered. The restaurant itself is beautiful; yes, the stairs are pretty cool. The service was quite friendly and we were served fairly quickly. The croque monsieur was tasty, though the coffee was not particularly memorable, certainly not for the price."
HIDE,5.0,"Two young kids (3, 5) and a tasting menu at a Michelin star restaurant often isn‚Äôt a good idea. It was the best experience at HIDE! We were all made to feel so welcome. Phenomenal food. The ‚Äúiconic‚Äù pairing was great. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more! Thank-you HIDE for an epic, memorable experience üôè"
HIDE,5.0,"Hide was definitely one of the best restaurants I‚Äôve ever eaten at in London! This was my fifth time visiting, and I usually spend a week dining out. I‚Äôm happy to say that Hide is in my top three!

The atmosphere is fantastic, the service is excellent, and the food was absolutely on point! We also tried a vintage dessert wine, which was just perfect.

We loved it so much that we recommended it to our friends, and they loved it too!"
HIDE,3.0,"Amazing front of house team. Amazing energy and warming team. Good mushroom, black pudding and sausage. Sour dough bread was super hard, tomato needs seasoning and flavour like the mushroom. Egg where cold and so was the pate"
HIDE,5.0,I visited Hide during December and to this day I still think of it often as their interior to their food was so memorable. Starting from the beautiful open inside that spirals up a mystical feeling tree carved stair case. The Croque Madame was incredible and their Nova Lox wrap was a very creative take on meal that I have myself often at home. Service here was great and drinks were also delicious.
HIDE,5.0,Just keep coming back! Food and Service outstanding and not to mention the wine list. Especially Sanita went above and beyond to share the secrets of the staircase. Will definitely be booking to come back soon.
HIDE,5.0,"Hide is just fantastic! The atmosphere is great and it is just a very good place to enjoy high quality food! From the pastries, to the sweets and savory tu dishes! Really enjoyed the experience!"
HIDE,5.0,Great spot for brunch for a special occasion - they gave me a card and a candle on my pastry for my birthday. Loved the truffle scramble eggs on toast and we also had the buckwheat pancake waffle with smoked salmon (less memorable). The pain au chocolate was also lovely though and the staff were super attentive and willing to go the extra mile to take photos for us. Coffee was also great and good selection of beans.
HIDE,5.0,Fantastic breakfast. The fresh sweet mango is prepared particularly special. We also had the avocado and poached eggs and fresh juices. The centre piece of the restaurant is the spiral hand carved staircase and the front door is also amazing in that it‚Äôs almost ‚Äúhidden‚Äù
HIDE,4.0,"We visited for breakfast, the pastries and croque Madame were really good. Unfortunately found the brioche for the truffle scrambled egg quite dry.
Service was great and was nice atmosphere."
HIDE,4.0,"Celebrated my birthday here last week. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. We got the bread basket (highly recommend), the nest egg (10/10), beetroot starter (7/10), scallops (8/10), mains were venison (7/10) and octopus (8/10), with a pear sorbet (9/10).

It was a great experience and the service was excellent! The decor is beautiful as well, we will be back to experience the breakfast:)"
HIDE,4.0,"I‚Äôve been here twice for breakfast/brunch. I wouldn‚Äôt say the food is amazing, but it‚Äôs really, really good. It‚Äôs a little pricey, but since it‚Äôs a fancy place, that‚Äôs expected. The ambiance is super stylish‚ÄîI especially like their area on the upper floor. My a√ßa√≠ bowl was just okay, but the matcha was really good, and the pastries were excellent."
HIDE,5.0,"Great meal out last night in the UK.  Order two bread baskets, one goes quick.  Food and service were outstanding.  Great night out."
HIDE,5.0,Been here twice for brunch. Once solo and one with friends for my birthday. Each time I received impeccable friendly service. The breakfast and pastries were both divine. Such a pretty restaurant too.
HIDE,1.0,"Lovely restaurant, swift service and great presentation. The price you pay, the portions you receive not worth it at all. Food was very average at best. Menu description was great and really oversold very average food.

Was not impressed with the way they portrayed the choice of waiters/waitresses for food service. They had chosen a few certain ethnic backgrounds which isn't an issue but the way they were serving was as if they had been told to act a certain way. Reminded me of slaves. Really not impressed."
HIDE,5.0,Great food. Egg royale is very recommended. The service was great and waited maximum 5 minutes until I got my order. Should note that the prices are high.
HIDE,5.0,"Loved the meal here! Serves were knowledgable, super friendly and they gave us a tour of the wine cellar too! Great evening out"
HIDE,4.0,"What a lovely experience.
We got a table that overlooked Green Park which was a lovely sight.
The food was good, perhaps slightly underwhelming for a one star restaurant.
Service was on point, the sommelier was very friendly and knowledgeable.
We didn‚Äôt feel rushed and enjoy every single minute of our experience.
For a treat, go and try Hide. You overall won‚Äôt be disappointed"
HIDE,1.0,"This restaurant has been our favourite for years, we always recommended it to friends and visitors. But the last visit was a waste of money, sadly. We couldn‚Äôt understand the change but later learnt that Ollie is no longer the chef there üíî he would have never put raw unseasoned cucumbers at the top like that. Smaller portions and thin flavour. I understand the loyalty to promote your other staff but won‚Äôt be surprised if you lose your star next year. The desserts were great but it‚Äôs just one course from 4 we tried. Gutted to lose this place ü•∫"
HIDE,5.0,"Is the staircase amazing? Yes
Is the service good? Yes
Is the food excellent? Yes
Is the view nice? Yes

But, I've had better pastries elsewhere in London for way cheaper (it cost me ¬£72 for 2 drinks and 3 dishes of food.)

It's definitely an experience and somewhere to have a celebration, but I don't think we'd ever come back on a whim."
HIDE,5.0,"Had an intimate wedding dinner in a private room (reading room). Thoughtful and whimsical decor. The staff was exceptional! Not only in knowledge of what they were doing, also very personal and authentic. THATS what you need in a great service team! Food was excellent as well, as expected from a Michelin Restaurant, but the service was what makes you feel at home. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è"
HIDE,5.0,"Very happy with the set lunch (though still pricey, nett ¬£64).
Lamb tartare starter - excellent, prata bread and greens complemented perfectly.
Steamed cod - excellent, flavourful mussel broth, perfectly cooked fish to the ideal texture, and a satisfying portion size
Lava tart and oak ice cream - average. Ice cream was quite melted (maybe the bowl wasn‚Äôt pre-chilled)"
HIDE,4.0,"We have lovely breakfast.  We like it esp the French Toast.
Both decoration and ambience is very nice."
HIDE,5.0,"One of my favourite restaurants in London. I‚Äôve been at least 8 times and the breakfast and lunch are both equally amazing, alongside the service and ambience. The bar downstairs is also great with wonderful negronis. The bread basket is the best bread basket I‚Äôve ever had."
HIDE,3.0,"Food was outstanding, but our service and experience was disappointing. I think we got unlucky with our waiter, we were left waiting 30 minutes to order our food and he got my main order wrong. He was very uncommunicative and didn‚Äôt double check our order at all. We were visiting for breakfast and got very hungry. I noticed people around us had a stall for their bags, but we weren‚Äôt given this. I was expecting a lot better from a Michelin star restaurant. We were visiting for a special occasion (anniversary) and did not feel like it was as much of a treat as it should have been."
HIDE,4.0,"Our first time here, ordered croque madame with truffle. It was pretty nice. Enjoyed much."
HIDE,5.0,Lovely restaurant with pleasant staff. Price commentate to location and decor. Food was good.
HIDE,1.0,"I was genuinely excited to have breakfast at HIDE, but left disappointed. I ordered the ‚ÄúRipe honey mango with Thai basil & kaffir lime‚Äù the description sounded refined and thoughtful. In reality, it was just two plain mango slices with a few micro herbs on top. No noticeable kaffir lime, no complexity, no special touch. Just mango. It felt more like a garnish than a standalone dish

Also, many dishes are not available for takeaway ‚Äúdue to sauces or presentation,‚Äù which makes it unnecessarily restrictive especially when the food is quite simple

A beautiful place, but the experience didn‚Äôt live up to expectations"
HIDE,3.0,"Style over substance. The bread is it's high and it goes down from there. Had the tasting menu which is hors d'oeuvre 3 courses and petit fours. For ¬£165 not good value! The food whilst cooked well was unimaginative and I wasn't wowed by the flavour. The lamb dish was a toughish piece of meat and the fat not rendered down.

Any easy pass"
HIDE,3.0,"I had high expectations for the food considering the Michelin star and the rave reviews online by influencers. Unfortunately, I thought that the food was lacklustre considering the price point and what the restaurant sets out to achieve.

Firstly, the French toast was decent but not amazing. The insides were more mushy than soft, hence there was a lack of bite to the dish.

Secondly, the croissants I ordered - chocolate and pecan banana were served cold, and I think they would have tasted better if they were warm. There was hardly any chocolate in the chocolate croissant at all.

Oysters were okay if on the small side.

Service was decent but restaurant was really busy on the day I went so staff was unable to interact much with guests.

Overall, would expect better for the price point of the restaurant."
HIDE,4.0,"Was there a few weeks ago to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday, and it was a great dining experience. The service was attentive, friendly, and thoughtful, making the occasion feel extra special.

The food was was beautifully presented. Some of the dishes that I enjoyed were so unique as well like the scallops specifically. The restraunt‚Äôs ambiance made this a memorable experience."
HIDE,5.0,"Staff were friendly and attentive, food and drinks were effortless, quick to arrive and very tasty for breakfast. The speciality coffee was amazing, have never tasted such a smooth coffee in my life. Price point was fair for quality and service. Can‚Äôt wait to come back, maybe for dinner next time."
HIDE,5.0,Fine dining done right! The food was great overall but the buckwheat pancake with salmon and cream cheese was the star of the show üåü
HIDE,4.0,"Great experience all round. Good food, excellent service and relaxed but still nice environment.
Stand-out menu item was the French toast. The banana pecan croissant was not everything it was hyped to be. Everything else was great."
HIDE,5.0,"It was an amazing celebration of my birthday in such a beautiful, cozy atmosphere of the highest quality restaurant in the heart of central London. Thank you so much for that evening üòä.  Everything was perfect üëå."
HIDE,5.0,We had an amazing anniversary dinner. Special mention to our server SINITA not sure of the spelling. But she really did a great job explaining the dishes to us. Our favorite is the carabineros prawns it was superb highly recommended. ü•∞
HIDE,4.0,"During my recent visit to The Hide, I found the food to be decent but not particularly remarkable. Among the dishes we tried, the egg nest and grilled octopus stood out as the better options, showcasing some creativity and flavor. However, the overall dining experience was marred by service issues.

It was a busy night at the restaurant, which undoubtedly contributed to the challenges we faced in getting attention from our server. We often found ourselves needing to flag down someone just to refill our water or wine glasses, which is frustrating during a celebratory girls' night out in London.

When our main courses arrived, there was a notable mix-up with the orders. The server seemed confused about which dish belonged to whom, which is quite unacceptable, especially in a busy restaurant setting. This added a layer of stress to the evening that detracted from our enjoyment.

Ultimately, the lack of timely refills for our drinks significantly impacted our experience. It‚Äôs disappointing when a night out is overshadowed by service shortcomings, despite the potential for a good meal. I hope The Hide can address these issues, as the food has promise, but the service needs improvement to match."
HIDE,5.0,"Visited HIDE for breakfast and I would say it has to be one of the most opulent breakfast experiences I've had!

The venue is truly stunning and ascending the iconic staircase to my table really set the scene for the experience.

I ordered the Full English with poached eggs and a Flat White. Both were excellent, every element of the breakfast plate was meticulously prepared and presented. The bread and butter were incredibly good and the eggs were poached to perfection. The coffee was also excellent, I chose an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee however there are a variety of coffees to choose from.

Service was relaxed and attentive without being overbearing.

It's not every day one gets the chance to have a Michelin-starred breakfast. It's a very enjoyable experience and one I would recommend!"
HIDE,2.0,"Ngl I feel like Ive just been scammed. Ridiculous price for such a bad experience, the starter was the first but not the last disappointment, I was expected to experience the journey of Italian cuisine, not an Asian parent‚Äôs simulator, the starter what was the name? Meat n Bones? Just a small piece of bacon wrapped around a bone like stick no taste no flavor just purely for show. It‚Äôs like you(an Asian) were presented with your firstborn child and you don‚Äôt know what to do with the child so you tried to give the kid every chances in life only for it to end up as a mixture of fancy useless failure. The rest of the dishes were the same as the first, bunches of f disappointment. The attitude of one of the waitress was not very polite, we were talking when the waitresses bring out the dishes and started coughing or something, trying to stop us from talking so she can introduce the dish(it happened many times not just once), very unprofessional, is what normal people would say but for me, she is a spoiled brat who were definitely raised by a bad single parent(clearly she did not know how to behave in such environment) because what she was doing not only damaged her reputation but the restaurant too, she must know that actions have consequences, I normally would leave a 15% tips but for her action I regret that I can not take the tips from her. (personally Im asian and where Im from, attitudes, especially in the service‚Äôs industry is everything, the key to success or their downfall). Last but not least, the atmosphere was in fact the most pleasant thing out of everything I had just mentioned above. The wooden stair was alright but still nothing impressive like Bacchanalia. For conclusion, save your money for other high-end restaurants, this one does not worth the hype nor the price. I only choose to go to this one on valentine because others are fully booked. Just for the final nail in the coffin, anyone know the differences between jokes and food from HIDE? Jokes have meanings. I am being generous to give it a 2 stars rating, it deserves 0,5."
HIDE,4.0,"Visited HIDE before Christmas for lunch.

Overall we found this place lived upto our expectations, with great front of house staff, lovely atmosphere and stunning surroundings.

The food was expectational but even for regulars to Michelin star restaurants, we found it very expensive."
HIDE,1.0,"Very bland fish with two pieces of a vegetable, 3 mussels and of course a foamy sauce. Pretty tasteless, not worth the hype. The waiter kept coming to talk to us which was irritating, called us ""his lovely ladies"" üôÑ Also we took tap water but they put still water on our bill and almost charged us."
HIDE,5.0,"From the moment I walked in, the space felt elegant but still super inviting, with all the natural light coming through those huge glass windows. Walking up the iconic staircase to my table really set the vibe for something special. The service was on point; really friendly and attentive but not over the top. For the quality of food and the whole experience, I‚Äôd say it was well worth it. If you‚Äôre looking for a fancy but relaxed breakfast spot in London, this is it. Whether you‚Äôre into Michelin-starred dining or just want to treat yourself, I‚Äôd definitely recommend giving it a try!"
HIDE,5.0,"To me, one of the best restaurants in London for all occasions. Service is exceptional. Ambience, food servicing, selection of spirits, it all gives you a unique experience.
My personal top choice is breakfast for sure, definitely go for French toast, and try any pastry (these are freshly baked every morning)
Dinner is also worth mentioning. Every dish is a masterpiece. From starters, I really enjoyed scallops and mackerel tartar.
As for the main, my go-to is octopus (it just melts)"
HIDE,4.0,"Service and location make this place worth a visit.  Sit on the 1st floor with a view of Green Park.    The Mango dish was yummy, but very small.    Croque Monsieur hit the mark."
HIDE,5.0,"Hands down best breakfast place in London. Obsessed with their food. Come here every couple of weeks to check out new pastries on the menu- always innovative! It is pricey, but as expected in Mayfair. Service not always on point (they seem to have a lot of rotation), but that‚Äôs just a detail and the food is worth it! Nice coffee selection with some interesting choices. Try it!"
HIDE,5.0,"One of the best dining experiences I've had, not just in London, but in all of the places I've ever travelled to. I was down with work and brought along my partner - and we both LOVED the food and hospitality was next level. Can't recommend this place enough to anyone that loves dining at the next level."
HIDE,5.0,"I unfortunately was not looking at the menu prices properly or it's just I didn't think that my starter which I chose XL size prawns wouldn't cost me a 90¬£ , but I was wrong and I actually didn't really enjoy them as of I payed 90¬£ ,but didn't had any satisfaction from having it. Glad it isn't me the one who payed our bill :)))"
HIDE,5.0,"This was our first time in a Michelin starred restaurant, and thus at HIDE. Everything was perfect, from service to food. Everyone was very welcoming, waiters gave us awesome food recommendations! For the quality of the food we tasted, this felt perfectly priced. This is hands on the best restaurant I‚Äôve been to.
I‚Äôd recommend trying the chicken liver parfait, and the chocolate pot, both were wow."
HIDE,5.0,"It was an amazing evening at HIDE. The team was so hospitable and delivered from the moment we stepped into the restaurant till the end.

From introducing the menu to giving recommendations, we were easily convinced by the knowledgeable staff.

Food in general was really presentable, we were a little underwhelmed by the highly acclaimed appetiser - nest egg. It was solid but it didn‚Äôt deliver the wow factor we were expecting. However, the meticulous craftsmanship dedicated to creating the dish and the egg itself was appreciated.

The mains were just gorgeous, we ordered chicken, pork and squid. They were all very delicious and cooked to perfection, we didn‚Äôt leave anything behind. We also really loved how the meat dishes were prepared in more than one ways, so you can get variations out of the dishes. It was a lovely bonus! We order some sides and they were all solid.

The highlight of the evening had got to be the acorn cake, we ordered one each and we all thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of the searing and bubbling cake, which was a well made brioche soaked in syrup, caramel and alcohol. It was dense, but it was divine.

The only hiccup that evening was the server of our table had been mixing up the sparkling and still water preferences for guests, at one point he even mixed different water into our glasses."

Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Came here for a birthday dinner with my partner, and the experience was truly exceptional!

The food was absolutely delicious, where the calf brain stood out as an especially memorable dish. The snails, lamb, and pheasant were all super delicious.

On top of that, the serving was absolutely excellent, where the waiter was incredibly helpful, friendly, and nice.

It was such an enjoyable experience that we booked in our next visit for my birthday dinner before we left.

Very highly recommend place, and I would argue it is the best place to eat in the area!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Had a wonderful experience at this restaurant!
Everything was delicious ‚Äî each dish was prepared with great care and full of flavour.
The atmosphere was top-notch ‚Äî cozy, stylish, and very welcoming.
Service was excellent ‚Äî friendly and attentive staff.
I really enjoyed it! üí´"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Love it, love it! Amazing food, impeccable service, great prices and lovely atmosphere. Though I live a little far away from their location, I will certainly frequent it and endure the longer-than-usual car ride.
Though I paid over ¬£100 per person, I ordered a large amount of food so that I try the tastefully curated menu.  Dave, the co-owner was most hospitable and made the night speciall"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Beautiful, authentic French food in a cosy setting (only 40 seats) with great personal service: there‚Äôs a reason why Bouchon Racine is a secret favourite for many and why tables are booked months in advance. The menu changes daily based on seasonality, but always delivers outstanding unpretentious quality. Highly recommended"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The best French bistro u can find in London.  I don‚Äôt generally go to the same restaurants again but this place is the place I would love to go every time!! The AMAZING food(the authentic French cuisine with quality), cozy environment, friendly but very professional staff.. I cannot recommend it more!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,This was an outstanding experience! This Bistro is over a 300 year old pub. The recipes are from Chef's French Grandmother. Everything was delicious! The duck market was devine-one of the best I've ever eaten. Chef tops it off with a sprinkle of breaded escargot--to absolutely die for--WOW-WOW--WOW!! The desert was also orgasmic. Service was lovely. And atmosphere delightful in the atrium. Will recommend to everyone who comes to London. Thank you!
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Fabulous.  We had an early table (6pm) on Wednesday evening.  The place was buzzing with a great atmosphere.   Service was second to none with staff being incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.  The food was outstanding.   We had girolles on toast and sarfette de banon (goat's cheese), figs and olive oil to start followed by rabbit, smoked bacon and mustard sauce and tete de veau with sauce ravigote. We also had sides of fries and creamed spinach with foie grass.   We finished with a petit pot au chocolate and a creme caramel with prune in armagnac. Highly recommended."
Bouchon Racine,4.0,"Delicious French restaurant in London. We loved the orzo (incredible), the rabbit and steak au poivre as well as the creme caramel and almond/berry tart. Some of the appetizers like the steak tartare, chicken liver pate and the zucchini salad were okay. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great French bistro."
Bouchon Racine,1.0,"One of the worst French restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to, the brill steak which costs ¬£42 tasted blend and literally only the fish and sauce on its own, the creamed spinach didn‚Äôt taste anything not even spinach and the pork was the only one which tasted ok, the baguette tasted like a baguette and chips tasted like average chips, Americano was awful. I saw the buying reviews stuff before came to the restaurant feeling bit unsure, it was packed in a Sat lunch, they did not approach to get a 5 star review. I have to say it‚Äôs one of the most not worth the price place to go‚Ä¶"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The most fantastic food and service
Phenomenal French food - the danger is you want it all! Great wine menu too the pub downstairs is fab as well and the lunches cooked by the same chefs are brilliant too. Hands down one of best places in London at the moment. üëåüèª"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Incredible experience. Shared the Herring starter, nice little taster. Then we dived into the Cote D'Boeuf, sensational taste and a massive portion for 2 people. Followed by a chocolate ganache which was rich and delicious. Everything was spot on, the serving staff, the food and the ambience."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Just had an incredible lunch at Bouchon Racine with friends! Despite not being familiar with all the French dishes, our server was fantastic, so thorough in explaining everything and offering great recommendations.

We started with the mangalitza ham and bread, which was absolutely divine. (Heads up, it's a fattier cut, so if you prefer leaner, keep that in mind!) For starters, the asparagus, morels, mangalitza, and comt√© dish was truly stunning, served in a rich butter sauce.
Our main, the sharing pork chop and sausage with a rich lentil base and tarragon/horseradish sauce, was outstanding.

I've been wanting to try Bouchon Racine for ages, and it completely lived up to expectations. Highly recommend ‚Äì can't wait to go back!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Honestly better to some of the bistros I went to in Paris! We arrived and were given a lovely table in their alcove, which had lots of good natural lighting and a lovely atmosphere.

We ordered the Steak Tartare, Goat Cheese Salad with Courgettes, and Bayonne Ham with Celeriac Remoulade to start, and the absolute star was the Steak Tartare. One of the best we‚Äôve had in recent memory. The sourdough rye was also a lovely accompaniment to it. The goat cheese salad was also very good, and I found the bayonne ham wonderful but the celeriac remoulade was very sharp and not to my taste.

For mains, we shared the Rabbit, Filet Au Poivre, and the Orzo. The Orzo was INCREDIBLE, and we also very much enjoyed the steak and rabbit. But something about the Orzo will have me thinking about it for days - what a dish!

We then had the creme caramel and colonel sorbet for desserts - one was sweet and the other more refreshingly sour, so we had a good balance to end the night.

We will definitely return!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"I love this place. It‚Äôs so timeless and charming and never gets old. Their changing menu means you can try something different every time. Steak au Poivre is a staple they do so well, with a side of their chunky frites and the most wonderful creamed spinach! Which was one of the reasons I went a second time. For dessert, the Creme Caramel and Pot au Chocolat are not to be missed. A rewarding experience for the struggle of getting a table."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Absolutely outstanding experience at Bouchon Racine! Service was great and warm, making us feel instantly welcome (even though we were the last ones there, they never rushed us out)
The place has charming vibe, perfect for enjoying a great meal.
And the food‚Ä¶ wow! From the oysters to the veal with Roquefort butter, everything was perfect. Even the fries were on another level! Also, the wine list is on top
I‚Äôll definitely be coming back, it's an unforgettable spot!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"My friend and I had a fantastic evening.

We were blown away by the chicken p√¢t√© ‚Äì it was seriously one of the best things I've ever tasted. The rabbit was also cooked to perfection.

The service was top-notch, the atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and the food was absolutely incredible.

I can't recommend this place enough!"""
Bouchon Racine,5.0,A menu full of excellent sounding dishes. Everything is perfectly prepared and delicious. Service is friendly and efficient. There is really nothing to fault here
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"New favourite French restaurant in London. The food was divine and the service very friendly and attentive. We had the chicken liver pat√© and endive salad as entree, and the rabbit in mustard sauce and bavette steak as mains.

Reasonably priced for a restaurant of such high quality! Highly recommended"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Exceptional. Top quality cooking. The beef tartare is incredible, wish I'd ordered the bigger portion. Rabbit perfectly cooked, with a well judged mustard sauce. The creme caramel is an absolute joy, could've eaten two. I ate on the balcony terrace, which is super cosy. The service was perfect, attentive but unfussy. Well considered wine list, sensible pricing and a good by the glass choice. Great value imho, considering the quality of the cooking and all-round experience. Looking forward to going back!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Cracking lunch - the roast chicken for two was massive and very very very succulent with a top notch sauce. Chicken liver pate hummed with smooth earthiness. Cr√®me caramel was bordering on ecstatic in its depths. Great friendly service too.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Love it, love it! Amazing food, impeccable service, great prices and lovely atmosphere. Though I live a little far away from their location, I will certainly frequent it and endure the longer-than-usual car ride.
Though I paid over ¬£70 per person, I ordered a large amount of food so that I try the tastefully curated menu. l went with my friends and we really enjoyed their food, service was top notch and great atmosphere.

Bouchon Racine,5.0,"An authentic bistro. There aren‚Äôt many French restaurant in London, so I‚Äôm grateful. Make sure to try the pudding for the desert. I‚Äôll definitely go there again!
And good for me, dogs friendly!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"You don‚Äôt get voted the best restaurant in the UK for nothing. Simply mind blowing. The service was some of the best with knowledgeable waiters who took time to make sure we ordered correctly. Food and wine are just some of the best you‚Äôll get to enjoy. Standouts were the oysters, snails, veal chop and the duck but dare I say I don‚Äôt think you could go wrong ordering anything from the menu. Sheer indulgence at its finest"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"I recommend Bouchon Racine if you are visiting a restaurant with high standards especially, taking friends and families. Their staff has a good attitude and their services are satisfying. The experience here is unimaginable and worth spending on their delicious meals."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The food is exceptional here and along with the service makes it one of the top restaurants in London for French cuisine. Both of my visits were great, loved the rabbit and the veal as well as the pork chop. Would highly recommend for a special occasion and not spend a fortune ( estimate ¬£100/person with a couple of drinks)"
Bouchon Racine,3.0,"The food was decent in general. I found it difficult to appreciate Tete de Veau as it was flavorless, quite fatty, and had very strange skin texture. The desserts were very good. I didn‚Äôt like the fact the restaurant cheekily added 1 pound charity donation to the bill without saying anything."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Tuck my mum out for lunch for her birthday she enjoyed it. Staff was amazing and was warm a friendly as soon as you walked in made you feel like you was a long time customer. I would definitely go again for that quality food at them prices I'll be going for full works and dragging my mum me for who evers birthday it is.

Chef also came out with a bottle of wine for her and a rose best chef ever"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,We had such a lovely experience at Bouchon Racine. The meal recommendations were exceptional and service was attentive! Thank you for a memorable meal.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Totally lived up to my expectation if not better!! Everything was delicious - the best end veal with the morels sauce was the highlight of the night. The meat was so tender and juicy, paired perfectly with the creamy sauce. Staff service was excellent we were unfortunately late due to the breakdown of the tube but the staff made sure that we were not rushed and enjoyed every single dish."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Wow! Has been my favorite restaurant in London for a long time. I think it was the sixth visit today and for the first time the food was not ten out of ten. However, the service and the way issues were impeccably dealt with, especially by Tilly has meant Bouchon Racine stays top of my go to and recommended list. Genuinely taken aback by how kind, reasonable and understanding they were when it wasn‚Äôt the usual impeccable standard ( shout out Tilly- she deserves a raise, because I‚Äôm sure I can be difficult!!) I‚Äôll be back as soon as I can get a reservation!"
Bouchon Racine,4.0,"Excellent French cuisine.
We‚Äôve order a decent amount for two people. Everything was accurate and delicious. Full of butter felt like an uplifted hidden bistro. The only dish we did not like was the famous eel salad. French fries were surprisingly moshie from the inside but super crispy on the outside. Orzo was also phenomenal and probably one of the best ones I‚Äôve ever had.
Desserts were light. I would avoid the Mont Blanc which was boring."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Haven‚Äôt had any luck with the reservation system but friend got a table so happily joined. It certainly did not disappoint although my stomach sometimes disagrees with the heaviness of French cuisine. It‚Äôs partially fault of our own as we almost ordered all the desert on offer - all are exceptionally good, in particular the Mont Blanc which has won my desert of the year award. The yellow chicken was also divine."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Great food and not too expensive. Enjoyed the experts behind the bar and the chefs were really talkative too.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"This restaurant offers a unique experience with its two-part setup. While the pub on the ground floor may not be visually appealing, the dining area on the upper floor transports you to a charming French ambiance. The highlight is the beautifully designed balcony with a glass ceiling, truly a marvel in London. Overall, the menu provides a fantastic variety. The signature chicken liver pate didn't suit my personal taste; the veal head, despite some traces of fur, and the surprising veal tongue were enjoyable. The expertly cooked rabbit leg surpassed some one-Michelin star establishments.This is a restaurant for true food lover. The value offered is commendable. However, it's worth noting that the national restaurant award's comment may have slightly exaggerated the food."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"My best experience in London! The food was beyond expectation. Everyone in service very nice and attentive. It was great overall. Booking a table is very hard, but don‚Äôt lose hope. If you call the restaurant they might help you for later months. The food is typical to Lyonnaise cuisine and delicious. I tried the veal (seasonal main), beef tartare, cheese and salad and 2 different puddings. I thought the meal was already the best, but believe me you haven‚Äôt had crem caramel before. It can‚Äôt be this good!! Looking forward to my next visit."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Came here for my birthday, the staff is lovely and kind and even gave me a drink on the house. The food was outstanding, some of the best meals ive tasted. And it was a beautiful calm aesthetic inside. 100% recommended coming here, definitely deserving of 5 stars and arguably more."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Really hard to book this restaurant but actually just need to give them a call in the morning. It's always full. Dinner time either 6pm or 8pm. I love the handwritten menu and I really like the rabbit in mustard sauce.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Was there on Thursday. Make a reservation from Singapore 1 week before I landed. Best to call them directly.

Love their food. It's more towards French Traditional cooking which you cannot find in Singapore.

A must try. Their menu is writing on a chalkboard so it changes from time to time.

Total damage was ¬£130+ for 2 appetizers, 2 mains, 2 glasses of wine, 1 btl of mineral water and a dessert.

I will said for the price and food type I will go back again and in Singapore you will never get to try these kind of food without burning a hole in your wallet"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Excellent meal and worth the wait. Can't fault the food, service, or bustling dining room. Absolutely loved the rabbit, pork salad, and the creme caramel with armagnac prune. Already booked a return visit!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Fantastic food and fantastic atmosphere. Came here for a birthday lunch and had a great time!!!
Bouchon Racine,4.0,"Lovely intimate restaurant with fantastic artworks and ambient lighting. Our waiters were very friendly and knowledge on all fronts from the food to the wine. The menu is truly authentic French cuisine, there is a dish to please all tastes but very meat focused. We thought the escargots were amazing! The white sausage was slightly too soft a texture and had an overly processed look about it. The rabbit was amazing with the haricot vert and mustard sauce, as were the fries. However the bavette was slightly chewy, so about 50/50 on very good to average."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"""I kept walking past it thinking 'no, that can't be it, that's a pub...'""

Once the final member of our dining party had pushed through the confusion to climb the stairs up to Bouchon Racine, we had the most spectacular sharing-style French meal seated around a round table in the middle of the restaurant, with the unmistakable buzz of ""London pints on a warm summer's day"" rising from the street below.

Every starter was a hit, but the Coombeshead Farm Mangalitza (platter of cured pork meat) and chicken liver pate accompanied by the most beautiful bread I can remember tasting were highlights.

For mains we opted for a series of sharing dishes, from cote de boeuf to assiette du Bouchon (a kind of platter of chicken and pork on lentils) to the 'best end' of lamb. A superb meat feast.

Finally, a taste of several desserts finished the meal brilliantly (though I could easily have eaten the apricot and almond tart all by myself).

Wonderful experience, and all the buzz is well deserved."
Bouchon Racine,3.0,Not very in line with my pallet of taste. The desserts were very enjoyable.
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Finally got to try Bouchon Racine and can certainly understand why it is always booked out! Menu is quite big on meats. We tried all the classic dishes, and everything was brilliantly seasoned. Loved the creamed spinach with foie gras and wish we had more fries or bread to finish it up. But the cr√®me caramel was definitely a showstopper. Would have gotten seconds, it is the best cr√®me caramel we‚Äôve ever had. Service was warm and friendly, staff were all very welcoming and ready to give honest recommendations if you ask!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,Fantastic food. Brilliant service. Cr√®me caramel is the best we‚Äôve tasted. Bravo!
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Bouchon Racine is a hidden gem that transports you straight to Paris. Every dish is beautifully executed ‚Äî the duck confit was melt-in-the-mouth perfection, and the wine list is superb. The intimate, relaxed atmosphere and genuinely warm service made the whole evening unforgettable. A true French delight in the heart of London. Five stars, without question."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Yes, I concur that Bouchon Racine is amazing! :) Delicious and delightful food.. the lovely setting eggs you onto having a most leisurely lunch. Enjoyed the bavette with sauce verte (although still reminisce about the veal chop from a previous visit). The Cr√®me Caramel is a showstopper!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Bouchon Racine is an absolute gem. From the moment you step inside, you're met with impeccable service that strikes the perfect balance between warmth and professionalism. The attention to detail is evident in every interaction, making the dining experience truly special.

Now, let's talk about the steak tartare‚Äînothing short of perfection. Fresh, expertly seasoned, and beautifully presented, it's a dish that lingers in your mind long after the last bite. The flavors are refined yet bold, showcasing the kitchen‚Äôs mastery.

Whether you're a devoted foodie or simply looking for a top-tier dining experience, Bouchon Racine is a must-visit. Highly recommended!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Got the first lunch table, which turned out well as it got quite busy! Food and service amazing. Had the oysters, a side of baguette slices, and the sharing rib-eye. Decent wine by the glass options"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"From the moment we arrived, the service was superbly professional without being stuffy. Our server described the blackboard menu with confidence and charm ‚Äî no pretension, just genuine enthusiasm for the food  . The front‚Äëof‚Äëhouse team earned high praise across the board: ‚ÄúFront of house 10/10‚Äù and ‚Äúgood honest service‚Ä¶"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"overall: authentic french bistro with every single dish to die for. great atmosphere for date night, fancy dinner or simply there to enjoy the food.

steak tartare üêÑ: a classic staple executed perfectly, served with warm crispy sourdough.

rabbit üêá: haven‚Äôt tried enough rabbit dishes to comment on the meat, but it has the same tenderness of chicken thighs. really enjoyed how the mustard sauce adds a mellow warmth.

bavette ü•©: perfectly cooked steak, still pink inside. salsa cuts through the greasiness of steak.

duck breast ü¶Ü: slightly chewy cut of meat (in a good way) with a strong gamey flavour.  love all the side veggies & THE SAUCE (love that they serve extra sauce on the side)

creamed spinach ü•¨: you can taste the umami from the foie gras. tho the texture can be a less creamy, as it was almost soup-like

cr√®me caramel üçÆ: simple but delicious

pot de cr√®me üç®: it‚Äôs not too sweet, which i love."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Up an unassuming staircase in a Farringdon pub lies London‚Äôs hottest new French restaurant. Getting a reservation was hard work, but it really paid off. The food and service in the small and cosy bistro is really good. Nice steak tartare, but the rabbit with bacon and mustard sauce was the showstopper. Good chips too. Dessert was probably the least impressive part of the meal, but the other courses made up for it. Service was excellent, and the staff were very friendly and helpful in choosing wines, refilling glasses and so on.
As a constructive feedback, I would like to see more wines on sale by the glass. They had only 4 reds and 5 whites by the glass.

Hope to be back soon."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"On Saturday afternoon, we tried our luck for lunch at a popular French restaurant in London. The uber driver couldn‚Äôt drop us off in front of the restaurant because of construction so we walked the rest of the way. There were hundreds of people shouting and what seemed like a protest in the same direction we were headed. But, as we got closer to the big crowd, we realised it was a tailgate party in front of a pub for the fans of the Luton Football club. They were really loud and cheering pridefully for their team prior to the game. It was a big game as a win would move them to the Premier League next season.

So we finally made our way into restaurant on the second level. Bouchon Racine was opened last October but they had a cult following for the chef. We were met at the front door by Dave. We told him we didn‚Äôt have a reservation and that we came a long way to try the food. The restaurant has a few empty tables waiting for the guests to arrive and Dave was doing his best to see if there were any no shows or cancellations but people were still making their way to the restaurant. Desperately hoping for some sort of miracle, Dave suddenly had an idea. He rushed out to the stairs area and quickly came back with a small table and two chairs. He found a corner to place the intimate table and we were set!

Dave brought over a chalkboard with a full hand written menu, he went over each item from the starters to desserts with extreme detail. We decide on the Tomato French bean anchovies salad and Chicken liver pate to start. It went so well with the red wine Peter, our server, recommended us.
For the mains, we went with the John dory mousserons leeks noir de bigorre ham and the Lamb chops wilted escarole rosemary garlic piment. The lamb dish reminded us of the mutton chops at the famous Keens Steakhouse in NYC. It was absolutely devine. Of course we had to have the Creme caramel armagnac prune for dessert, it was so creamy. üòã‚ù§Ô∏è A French meal would not be completed without a coffee and a glass of Armagnac.

Everything was so good, that we couldn't help but to look again and again at the chalkboard menu, thinking of what we could have tried. Haha üòÅüòÅüòÅ Thank you Dave and Peter for your genuine hospitality. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"We had a fantastic weekend lunch here. The food was fantastic, can‚Äôt wait to go back and try more. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Had really good time. Highly recommend."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Wonderful ‚ÄòGoldilocks‚Äô brasserie - it‚Äôs not too big, not too small; not too expensive but really not cheap; relaxed pace but good service‚Ä¶ The menu however is no compromise - excellent ingredients, taste-first cooking with charming presentation and lick-the-plate finish.
It‚Äôs non-showy. You can have a date or business lunch there and focus on your guest without the food piling you in the eye. It does however infuse a certain chuckle of joy and anticipation to proceedings and it‚Äôs memory may outlive the business or the relationship ;)
Sadly it‚Äôs now so (deservedly) popular that bookings are like hen‚Äôs teeth and so a long or lucky game needs to be played. It‚Äôs worth it though. Just go."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Bouchon Racine is a cozy neighborhood gem tucked above a pub, offering an intimate candlelit dining experience full of charm. The chalkboard menu showcases fresh, seasonal produce, and the wine list is both carefully curated and reasonably priced. The service is attentive and warm, adding to the overall inviting atmosphere. Though tables can be hard to come by, the effort is absolutely worthwhile for such a delightful dining experience. Highly recommended!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Have had a reservation booked for a few weeks to treat myself and my partner to a nice good meal. Having read reviews, we were buzzing to see what the fuss was about and we were not disappointed. We had warm baguette with salty butter for appetiser. I had the summer orzo, a mouth-watering, creamy, delicious vegetarian dish, a glass of wine and the creme caramel whilst my partner had veal chop with blue cheese butter, a chocolate pot and a glass of port. Between us, we paid ¬£110 inc service, not bad for how good the food was. The atmosphere and decor was amazing. Service was outstanding. Really really enjoyed it and am be keen to come back."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"These two know how to do restaurants and they know how to do French. A menu full of classics - think rabbit in mustard sauce, kidneys, escargot and celeriac remoulade - of the type sometimes difficult to find when you‚Äôre actually in France. Lovely."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Fantastic French food in a very nice setting. The food is really great and has that rustic quality that you could find in a forgotten village in the middle of nowhere in France; the bayonet ham with celeriac remoulade was perfect, the chicken liver p√¢t√© with cornichons was outstanding and the rabbit with bacon and mustard dressing was superb. The dessert was a creme caramel with Armagnac and prunes and I had also the petit pot au chocolat. Both very good . The service is attentive and competent. I suggest to go in a group of at least 3-4 people as there were so many things in the menu that I would have loved to taste but couldn‚Äôt as I was on my own . The cuisine is the kind of French food that uses everything, including parts of the animal that we are not used to taste anymore ; it is cooked with love and precision and it is similar to the kind of cooking made by French grandmothers who were able to conjure up amazingly satisfying meals with whatever they had in the kitchen .  The wine list is good and very reasonably priced. Book in advance and go"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Amazing food, really good service they were lovely and helpful- Cr√®me caramel is my favourite dessert and the one here was delicious!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"We came for a mid week dinner and really enjoyed the food, service, atmosphere. The space is also really nice and lovely. Between the three of us, we shared a bottle of white, the oysters (so fresh), bayonne ham with celeriac, chicken liver pate (both good) for starters, orzo with wild mushrooms and herbs (really rich but tasty), rabbit, mustard and bacon (nice flavour), dover sole meuniere (nicely cooked and was my favourite!) with a side of chips (these were just ok) for mains and the meringue montmorency for dessert. As most of the dishes are rich, I recommend sharing all the dishes so you can try a bit of everything. The menu changes often so I am looking forward to going back at some point. Staff were really friendly, attentive and helpful too!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The service was impeccable. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, and genuinely passionate about the menu, guiding us through the choices with expertise and enthusiasm.  Their recommendations were spot-on, and they were always present without being intrusive.The food itself was nothing short of extraordinary. Each dish was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation, showcasing the chef's mastery of technique and creativity.  The ingredients were clearly fresh, seasonal, and of the highest quality.  We started with the [mention a specific appetizer you liked, e.g., escargots, which were cooked to perfection], followed by the [mention a specific main course, e.g., perfectly seared duck breast, a symphony of textures and tastes].  The [mention a specific side dish, e.g., creamy polenta] was a wonderful complement. And the dessert?  Simply divine!  [Mention the dessert and your reaction].The wine list was extensive and impressive, offering a wide selection to pair perfectly with the menu.  Our sommelier's suggestions were excellent, enhancing our dining experience even further."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Attentive service. They come to you with a huge slate with hand written items and take care to explain all of them :)

Nice and cosy atmosphere. I really love this place. Food really stands out. Smaller portions but very richly prepared, amazing bread, lots of meat options. Truly authentic French as far as I can tell :)"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Social media was right on this one! First of all, the team was very friendly and likeable! They also didn‚Äôt rush us out after lunch, so we could talk and enjoy our food in a relaxed way.

Secondly, we sat near the windows and that area was so well-lit by the daylight! Beautiful! And because it was winter, they had the heating on, another major plus.

For the food, such great flavours. I had the hake as a main and it was very light. I‚Äôd never had escargot before, but after having it here, I can definitely recommend it. Not too chewy and the garlic butter wasn‚Äôt overpowering at all.

I‚Äôd love to go back, what a gem of a place."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"The service was perfection, perhaps the best I have ever experienced in London. Loved the wine selection; what a delight to see a Vermouth Rouge on the aperitif list. The creamed spinach was a highlight!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"A Hidden Gem with Timeless French Elegance

Bouchon Racine is an absolute treasure. From the moment you step inside, you‚Äôre transported straight to a classic French bouchon‚Äîwarm, intimate, and effortlessly charming. The service is impeccable: attentive without being overbearing, and genuinely passionate about the food and wine they serve.

The menu is a love letter to traditional French cuisine. I had the oeufs mayonnaise to start‚Äîperfectly balanced and simple in the best way. The andouillette was bold and beautifully prepared, and the gratin dauphinois was the ultimate comfort dish, creamy and rich without being heavy. Every bite felt like it had a story behind it.

The wine list is thoughtfully curated with a strong focus on small French producers, and the staff are more than happy to guide you through it.

Whether you‚Äôre a long-time Francophile or just looking for a memorable dining experience, Bouchon Racine delivers in every way. I can‚Äôt wait to return."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,The magret de canard and the creme caramel were perfect. The prince de paris and the steak tartare were good too. Can‚Äôt wait to go back and try the rest of the dishes.
Bouchon Racine,1.0,"I‚Äôd love to be able to reviewing them restaurant but there are no slots within 30 days unless you want to eat at the dead of night or in the middle of the day on a work day.

I called and called. Left messages. No answer. Emailed; no answer.

Waste of time. Would not recommend"
Bouchon Racine,4.0,"Very cosy atmosphere and ambience. Friendly staff. Overall, my experience was positive. All the mains were great. I particularly enjoyed the cote de boeuf. Starters and desserts however could be improved. The mont blanc dessert was far from what you get in France.
You really need to like french cuisine or you will be disappointed. Also, if you are vegetarian I suggest you go elsewhere as there was only one option on the menu.
All in all, I would recommend giving Bouchon Racine a try üëç"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Fantastic food in a relaxed airy bistro. The duck was particularly impressive as was the rabbit, which was accompanied by some truly exquisite bacon.
Great service rounded off the experience - highly recommend!"
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"I just loved it.  Friend had booked a late table on a Tuesday night and there was still so much atmosphere.  The team were professional and charming.  The place is intimate yet cool.  Loved the blackboard menu.
Food was beautiful.  Good portion size.
I need to go back.  I had no room for dessert and there is still so much I want to try from the menu.  Mainly the t√™te de veau."

Waitress... ""Are ya done yet?"" Thats how she addressed me ""yes""
Multiple times too!

If you sell decent food you need to back your customers up with a decent attitude.
The foods pretty basic too on its premise. So at these prices I would demand perfection..
Celebrity chef reviews, we won this blah blah, not good enough if you don't back it up with service..
Will never go back."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,The food is really outstanding! Every meal we had was full of flavor and cooked to perfection
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Tucked away in the heart of London, this French gem offers a charming escape to Paris without ever leaving the city. The atmosphere is effortlessly elegant‚Äîthink soft candlelight, tasteful d√©cor, and the kind of quiet buzz that makes conversation feel special.
Service was warm and professional, with staff who clearly know and love their food. The sommelier recommended a Burgundy red that paired beautifully with our meal."
Bouchon Racine,5.0,"Amazing restaurant,I have been a chef for over 20 years and eat out a lot and this is by far the best French food I have ever had! Top notch!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic lunch!
Such a beautiful restaurant!
Intimate, friendly, special.
The chefs produced the most exquisite flavours, which we devoured!
Audrey was very knowledgeable about all the wines and was lovely too.
Highly recommend this restaurant, it‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs delicious and it‚Äôs small and intimate. Everything is done in front of you, absolutely loved it!
Will be back, I wish Andy continued success."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great experience. Fantastic for those who love seafood, as it's the focus of their menu. They're not necessarily pushing boundaries with their cooking, but their quality and skill is undoubted. Very well deserved of their michelin star, probably one of our favorite 1-star restaurants in London now."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Behind is an absolute gem, easily the best meal I‚Äôve had this year. From the moment you step inside, the atmosphere feels warm, refined, and welcoming. The open kitchen concept makes dining here an incredible experience ‚Äì you get to watch a passionate, highly skilled team at work, and the precision and artistry behind every plate is mesmerising.

The food is exceptional. Every course is beautifully thought out, with bold flavours balanced perfectly and ingredients allowed to truly shine. You can tell there is genuine care and creativity behind every dish, and the pacing of the tasting menu is spot on. The wine pairings were equally impressive, elevating the whole evening.

Service was faultless ‚Äì attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable, and genuinely enthusiastic. It‚Äôs rare to find a place where every detail, from presentation to hospitality, feels so considered.

Well done Andy and team üëèüèº"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Excellent in all ways. Incredible flavours with a wide range, from fresh asian to rich french styles. Brilliant, especially for pescatarians"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"It was a fantastic experience, showing just how unique flavours can come from simple ingredients. Perfect for seafood lovers, though they‚Äôre more than happy to accommodate non-meat eaters as well. While we expected mostly seafood, the chef surprised us with refreshing herb sorbets and fruity shots between courses, which was a delightful touch. The atmosphere is definitely more relaxed than most fine dining spots, with soft lighting and mellow music adding to the charm. The chefs were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making it feel almost like dining at home with friends. And don‚Äôt miss out on checking the unique restrooms while you‚Äôre there."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing. Incredible. Phenomenal. What a bloody treat! Went there last night and from start to finish it was incredible. The ten courses each had their own spectacular taste and we decided to go with the wine pairing - the wine glasses were extremely generous. The restaurant was very accommodating to my allergies - they even remembered them and the dish i had as a replacement was potentially my favourite (i did mention for it to be put back on the menu!). Really thank you for such an incredible night, we really won‚Äôt forget it. Special mention to Connor, Audrey, Olivier, Giorgio and Andy (sorry if I missed anyone). Will be telling everyone about this night for many years to come."
Behind Restaurant,4.0,"Good food and creative dishes at Behind.

Had the tasting menu on the 7th of February.

Highlights is the broth dish and the ice cream in the end! The apple skin and carrot juice is also amazing and very refreshing!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"What a place! The food was fantastic. This is probably my favourite spot I‚Äôve been to in London. Interesting seafood focused food with some twists. They use the sauce and natural ingredients for the flavour no unnecessary added salt or sugar here - really packs a punch. The head chef is a lovely chap as well and so are his staff - the front of house staff member and the other chefs / servers were also great. Lean and effective team. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. They could also accommodate me being a pescatarian as well very easily and didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it (just let
them know in advance). To top it all off my girlfriend and I had a lovely bottle of rose. They‚Äôve nailed the design inside and the vibe is cool but not over the top. Nothing too fancy. Spot on."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,A super friendly and down to earth team serving exquisite food from multiple influences. Such a great experience!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Incredible experience here at Behind. From the moment we stepped in we felt special and truly part of an experience. Starting off with incredible drinks from the sommelier who really knew what she was doing to being served our courses by the chefs themselves. Each course was special within its own right but led beautifully to the next. If you want to truly taste something amazing in London then you must book the tasting menu here!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Here‚Äôs a great example of a Michelin-experience made right.

Setting is a very design-friendly chefs table with the perfect ambience and acoustics. Service is right on point with great hosting, relaxed conversations and highly knowledgeable about their food and preparation.

The food follows the key. Perfectly, and thoughtfully, balanced and prepared to give you something from the whole taste palate.

Went for the lunch set-menu, which was very good value-for-monetary ¬£64pp. Highly recommend other to do the same, or entrust them for a dinner. I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

- Value for money? Yes
- Worth a detour? Yes
- Best for (occasion)? Foodie experience
- Would I go back? Absolutely"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Seafood, made magic. The mixture of textures alone on each dish will surprise you in the best possible way. A delight."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"From the moment we walked in, the service at this restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. The waitstaff were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely warm, striking the perfect balance between professionalism and friendliness.

As for the food and drinks‚Äîdivine is the only word that fits. Every dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor, clearly crafted with care and fresh ingredients. The cocktails were equally impressive, with a creative flair and perfect balance.

This place delivers an experience that delights all the senses. Highly recommended."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Had the most unforgettable dining experience at Behind.

The intimate setting, paired with a warm and passionate team, set the stage for a stunning 10-course seafood tasting menu that was nothing short of artful. Each dish was incredible, but the standouts for me were the scallop with kipper sauce and the Sicilian red prawn. I‚Äôm still dreaming about them."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Every dish was superb these chefs know what they‚Äôre doing‚Ä¶created an amazing space to enjoy amazing seafood fine dining. One of my favourite restaurants in London.

All dishes are served by the chefs themselves no waiters no menus everything is a surprise and explained by the chefs. Definitely a food experience. Highly recommended."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"I heard so many good things about this place before I decided to make a reservation. To be honest, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of seafood but I was convinced to give this place a shot and safe to say I was not disappointed at all.

8-course tasting menu ¬£118 pp (when i went) and one-seating per night. Unlike some fine dining restaurants, Behind was bang for buck. Each dish was well crafted with a lot of thought put into it.

I would say that I felt like the food had a lot of elements of Japanese-like flavours which was very much to my palette!"
Behind Restaurant,4.0,"I recently had the opportunity to dine at this chef's table, known for its surprise seafood-focused menu. Here's my take on t to he experience.

The service was a bit of a mixed bag. It wasn't unfriendly, but it didn't quite exude the warmth you'd hope for in a dining establishment. It seemed as though the staff were efficient but not overly engaging.

Now, onto the food. The meal started on a high note with the first few dishes, which were truly enjoyable.

However, it was disappointing that the latter dishes were marred by excessive saltiness, which left a less than pleasant aftertaste. It was a sharp contrast to the promising start.

Overall, dining here is indeed an experience, but it may not be one that compels me to return. While the surprise menu and the initial courses were memorable, the inconsistency in service and food quality left a lot to be desired. If you're an adventurous diner looking for something different, it might be worth a try, but be prepared for a mixed experience."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Exceptional, if you haven‚Äôt been there you need to go. A unique experience and more than worthy of its Michelin star"
Behind Restaurant,1.0,"It‚Äôs the worst Michelin restaurant experiences I‚Äôve ever had, especially the service part. Chef Andy Beynon is very rude. There are way better Michelin (and non Michelin) restaurants elsewhere.

I arrived on time while my friend was late.
There was miscommunication about the serving with the manager at the beginning as I asked if they can save for my friend what she might miss and serve her when she arrives. She says they will try accommodate. In that case, when the chef Andy later came and ask me if I want to start or wait for my friend, I said I‚Äôll wait. What he didn‚Äôt mention at all is that if I don‚Äôt start without my friend I won‚Äôt be served some of the first courses. Neither on the booking email or on their website says ‚ÄòFood is STRICTLY served all together with all guests and you as a guest paying us money for an experience won‚Äôt be served the food even if we agreed to accommodate a situation.‚Äô He says it‚Äôs ‚Äôobvious‚Äô when he asked me if I want to start. When I asked about it later after realising I was not served the first few courses he said ‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt get it because your friend was late. Nothing I can do and I have no solution.‚Äô No smile, cold face, great customer service."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Sitting at the chef's table was an amazing experience. Alongside only 8 other guests, we watched the chefs prepare and serve our meals while taking the time to explain them to us. The place felt cozy and stylish and talking to the chefs made it very special. Just for this, they deserve top marks.

As for the food, it was mostly fish dishes. The meal started with mackerel and trout, both with surprising flavors that balanced well. Everything was nicely done. The prawn broth and pumpkin crab ravioli were my favorites. The cod cheek looked great but tasted too salty and needed something more, maybe a bit of sourness. But that didn‚Äôt impact our 5 star experience."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"A true masterpiece of fine dining, this world-class restaurant delivers an unforgettable experience. The service is flawless, the ambiance is refined, and every dish is a work of art‚Äîboth visually and in flavor. Highlights include expertly prepared courses, thoughtful wine pairings, and a kitchen that blends precision with creativity. From start to finish, it‚Äôs a seamless journey through culinary excellence."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"This was my birthday treat and absolutely one of the best meals I've ever eaten.  The room is amazing, the cooking is exceptional and the staff wonderful.

Impossible to pick a standout course as every dish was fabulous, having everything brought by the chefs was lovely and Andy is an incredibly talented man and a genuinely lovely person."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great overall experience and delicious food. The tasting menu was well crafted and creative, focused mainly on fresh seafood. The layout of the restaurant and the atmosphere was excellent as all the guests sits facing the open kitchen and see the food being prepared. Service was also brilliant as the staff will give you a brief intro of each dish. Highly recommended."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Our six-course chef's tasting lunch menu at Behind was a special treat. Five chefs and no wait staff. The chefs served and explained the dishes one by one. The visual feast, the intense flavours, the anticipation as we watched them working in the kitchen and plating to perfection ‚Äì it all added up to a supremely special experience. I do wish they'd given us a menu because there was an incredible amount of detail in every dish and I can't remember it all.

The photos show all five chefs at work. The first course was the only one that had more than one component ‚Äì four in all. The silky striped sauce was added at the table to great effect. Two or three trout eggs are nestled amongst the edible flowers. The tasty crispy cracker was so thin it melted in your mouth. The next course was half a quail egg filled with teensy little shrimp with tiny black eyes surrounded by delicate ramen and ""sea ramen."" All eaten with a utensil that looked like a small pair of tongs, much easier to wield than chopsticks. On finishing, we were advised to pick up the bowl and slurp down the divine broth. The dessert was some of the best chocolate I've ever had with another cracker, sweet this time, and a perfect quenelle of ice cream in between. (My daughter told me that's what it's called - she's passionate about food and researches where to eat whenever I visit her in London from Canada.)

We also really enjoyed the five chefs and their multiple nationalities and accents. A marvellous experience overall."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Wonderful dining experience. All the dishes tasted amazing. Love the relaxing atmosphere. They have a small team of chefs and staffs, yet they are all very friendly. Great value for money. Highly recommend this restaurant!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Going to Behind is an experience.
We went to a lot of great restaurants already, but this one is special. The chefs are doing The cooking which you can see from your seats and at the same time they are also serving it. The chef Andy Beynon is super friendly and talks with the guests and explains if necessary. It is a super great, casual atmosphere and a different approach to a Michelin Star restaurant.
The menu is super nice and it becomes better and better from course to course. The chocolate dessert is the best I ever had! I really cannot understand how you can still be hungry afterwards. It was really a special night."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Excellent menu, great atmosphere. All cooking is done in front of you so it makes it a little interactive as well. Servings are well spaced out and not too slow as other reviews mention. Plenty of food overall, with some great flavours and textures. The brioche croissant is unbelievable. Would come again."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Today's food experience was lunch at @behindrestaurant in London Fields, London. The surprise seafood-focused menu was sensational. From the minute I arrived, there was chatty conversation from the chefs who then cooked and served each of the courses. Such a fun afternoon with a front row seat to some really fabulous food."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"A must go if you‚Äôre a foodie in London restaurant scene. Chefs table style design. Amazing fish menu where you find out whilst you eat and they surprise you with each and one of the dishes. Service is phenomenal, shout out to Nathan and Jonny who made our stay one to remember."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing food and service. Very unique and intimate experience, with only 12 other diners. Open kitchen concept allows you to admire the craft and art that goes into the food. Glad I got to try this place out and would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"The food and service were absolutely sublime. The savoury dishes were all perfection, my personal favourite being the chicken and Sea Bream. Magical, only downside is the shared bathroom with the hotel."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Behind offers an exceptional dining experience with its unique open-kitchen concept, allowing diners to witness the artistry behind each dish. The tasting menu is a delightful journey of flavors, showcasing seasonal ingredients and creative combinations. Each course is beautifully presented and thoughtfully prepared. The staff is knowledgeable and attentive, enhancing the overall experience. A must-visit for those who appreciate fine dining with a personal touch"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing Dinner, outstanding service, My out of town guest was very impressed. Every dish on the menu was carefully designed to match the highest standard and exceeded our taste buds expectations."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Can‚Äôt fault it! Amazing seafood-based tasting menu with combination of great flavours. Modern open plan set-up but feel very cosy. Chefs introduced each dish to us when serving and it was a very enjoyable and personal dining experience.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great laidback atmosphere with fantastic food. Very good prize-value proposition for a tasting menu of such quality in London.

Definitely recommend, specially for someone who wants to try their first one-star Michelin Restaurant. Or whoever wants to have good produce with inventive combinations of flavours without paying a fortune.

Would advise them to have a landline in case customers need to reach them (which was my case)."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"A remarkable, intimate and truly delicious lunch. I highly recommend it for lunch or dinner. The room is so beautiful and the service was impeccable. Chefs will serve and then discuss the dishes. Don‚Äôt miss Behind üôåüèª"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Went here for my birthday and really enjoyed my time there! A seafood inspired restaurant in Hackneyü§© would love to revisit but sadly they don‚Äôt give birthday surprises..
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"6 stars all round. Inconspicuous setting for such an elaborate and lavish occasion. Sumptuous interior design elements underpinning the attention to detail for the whole operation - from greeting to goodbye.

And the food reflects all of the above and so much more. Confident, almost effortless flavour combinations."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Andy Beynon's restaurant is a wonderful space that reflects his passion and drive. There is an 18-cover copper horseshoe counter encircling the kitchen with a couple of rectangular tables almost in the kitchen space itself, all with fantastic views of the meal as it is being prepared. The ceiling is warehouse bare and the music reflects Beynon's personal tastes and is balanced to the course being offered. Beynon is an accomplished chef and a charming host. The chef and his brigade are part of the service at Behind, talking to diners about each dish as it is presented to them.

I have sampled some of Beynon's creations at City and Pollen Street Socials, when he was Jason Atherton's development chef, as well as at Hibiscus where he supported Claude Bosi. He has imagination and flair and it is little surprise that he landed a Michelin star within 21 days of opening his own place.

We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu as a surprise (i.e. we did not want to know in advance what we would be eating). The whole room gets the same meal, with slight adaptions for dietary requirements. We also asked for the wine pairing. It is clear from the wine list that Beynon values artisan producers and is ethically inclined - there are many organic options from small vineyards across the globe.

The main focus is on seafood, sustainable, best-on-the-day produce that is served with care and a keen attention to detail. The brigade are not trapped at a particular station but move according to their role, as well as coming out of the kitchen to present their creations. On our visit we enjoyed fresh peas, smoked trout and pike garnished with trout roe, served in a paper thin fine pastry shell with pea shoots - a wonderful, textured mouthful; native oyster taco and oyster with cucumber, buttermilk, horseradish and oyster foam; crab pannacotta with white meat and sliced sharp gooseberries from Beynon's mother's allotment - a successful combination that has made more people than just his mother smile; another crab dish with ajo blanco and melon and cucumber balls with a warm crab broth and fine sardine toast; scallops with pickled fennel; wonderous hake, roasted, in a sherry sauce, served with fish croquettes coated in crisp scales and a silky, smoky mash scattered with seeds (the wine pairing to this was sublime - a glorious Spanish Red tasting of smoked Ribena); tender 7 day-hung guinea fowl accompanied by a superb South African granache from Wellington; a potion of rhubarb served in a tall glass with a foam to cleanse the palate; a subtle herb sorbet (basil, tarragon and verbena) served with lemon curd custard - quite sublime with a sharp raspberry and calamari sorbet with white strawberries as a refreshing finisher; a white chocolate and cardamom bomb; and a going home gift of freshly baked brioche pastry to go with coffee next day - a delicious reminder of the night before.

Beynon is a cool Hackney resident running a very cool Hackney venue. That he finds time to be a loving father and husband on top of steering his culinary dream is amazing. He recruited one of his brigade when the pair of them were taking their kids out for a stroll and recognised each other and got talking. Great to live and work locally at such a fantastic restaurant. Thank you for wonderful evening."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"This is the ultimate restaurant for all seafood lovers who want to experience a unique tasting menu using only the best products the UK waters have to offer.
My partner and I had a delicious anniversary celebration and we enjoyed every single bite of their seafood tasting menu - thank you team!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Sublime. We had a great time, food was amazing and so were the staff. Weve been to Michelin Star places and often leave wallet lighter & thinking nothing more than 'it was ok'. Not here, here I felt like I had my first Michelin star experience. The food is art on a plate and each plate an explosion of flavour. Their wine paring is by far the most generous Ive ever had, we both left a little bit wobbly on our feet.

If you love seafood you will love this place."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"We had dinner in this restaurant a few days ago- highly recommended place! Very affordable prices, nice and friendly waitresses. Definitely one of our favorite restaurant now! 10/10"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Very nice experience at Behind Restaurant.  From start to finish each dish is a new experience of tastes and flavors.
Each cooking is measured to perfection.
The dishes are balanced and respect each product.
Having less even worked at ""La Tante Claire"" with Pierre Kaufmann, at ""The Terrasse restaurant"" at the Dorchester, ""the Waterside Inn"", with Michel Roux and also at the ""Gravetye Manor"".
I can only congratulate chef Andy Beynon and  his entire team for the work accomplished.
Continue to work and respect the fresh products you serve us.
Once again congratulations for this wonderful moment."
Behind Restaurant,4.0,"1 Michelin star spot with a great sweeping wooden table top counter dining that seated 14 around it. Very close to brat at climpsons arch in London fields. Firstly the staff were all fantastic - the chefs served all the dishes and were really approachable and great to chat about the food and menu with. The sommelier was also particularly friendly and knowledgeable and just a lovely person. Really nice to see Andy Beynon himself taking time to chat with all the diners in the restaurant and clearly took pride in his food and the restaurant.

In terms of the food itself, it‚Äôs a surprise seafood focussed tasting menu (you get the menu at the end as a takeaway), with c.14 courses which means each is relatively small and ultimately very ‚Äúfine dining‚Äù if you know what I mean, but not necessarily in a good way. Whilst everything was cooked well with ok flavours, it‚Äôs hard to classify many of the dishes as truly standout that you are going to be yearning for over the next few days/weeks/months or raving about to friends and family. It was all technically proficient cooking for sure but would love to see some more innovative ideas on the plate and more knockout flavours. Crab, hake, and guinea fowl dishes were the highlights for us. Total bill c.¬£208 for two with a couple of drinks each. Overall 13/20"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Absolutely loved this place. Every course was amazing which is rare to hit it all and also very reasonably priced. Very seafood heavy but I love seafood and the mash was just ridiculous! Thank you for the best evening!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"So lucky to be able to finally get a reservation!! Absolutely amazing, I had a wonderful time. All o the dishes were delightful. It was definitely an experience."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Absolutely amazing!! The food was an excellent mix of interesting flavours. The staff were absolutely lovely & the wine pairings were perfect. Such a treat & worth every penny!!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Loved our meal here - each dish was delicious and the whole open plan vibe of the restaurant made it feel really intimate. Not the sort of place I would visit frequently but an ideal place for a treat!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Food was absolutely incredible and overall a wonderful experience from Andy and his team. Personal and Intimate setting. A hidden gem in East London, everyone must go. A well deserved Michelin star!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Came here for friend‚Äôs birthday. Had very high expectations and it was decent. We were still hungry after the tasting lunch menu though üòÇ
Behind Restaurant,2.0,"Big disappointment

Portions are tasty but very small and I was still hungry after the 8 courses tasting menu. The chef proposed an extra dessert for customers who were still hungry like me. I thought it was going to be free but was charged extra.
The service is good but it was the first time I left a Michelin star restaurant hungry and wanting for more, even after spending 300 pounds for 2 people."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,10 courses served over 3 hours. Brilliant food and wine pairing as well as amazing service.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Lovely space and atmosphere. Enjoyed the seating arrangement where you can watch the chat with the chefs. Enjoyed the fish based concept and the wine pairing was amazing.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"East London is spoilt for choice with regards to fantastic eateries and Behind is another welcomed addition to the scene. Fantastic seafood focused tasting menu, and their sardine on toast something out of this world.  Cannot fault anything."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"We had an incredible time at Behind with Andy, Jimmy and the crew.  The tasting lunch menu with wine pairing was simply sublime from start to finish - all I can say is just go."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Wow fine dining at its very very best. The food the chef's served up were nothing more than spectacular. The staff were very friendly and polite. The atmosphere was perfect dining with friends. I can't wait to go back
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"phenomenal!! andy gets the atmosphere and vibe perfect. great food served by the chefs in a casual laidback style - the team are great. the cooking is balanced and refined - exploring a few different cuisines (the mini-ramen was one of my favourites). and the wine pairing was very well selected and in tune with the foods,  I like the use of some smaller producers you might not have tried before. Next time i‚Äôm in London this will be the first thing i book!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic restaurant. Food was delicious and hot . The service was incredible. The staff was so approachable, nothing was to much trouble for them . The menu has plenty of choices . Will definitely be returning when in that area .
A must go to ."
Behind Restaurant,3.0,"Pros: The room design is unique and chefs will make you feel like a king with a fairly personalized service; flavours are pretty good; lunch menu is quite affordable too. Having said that, some cons you need to consider: 1) lots of downtime ‚Ä¶"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Superb. beyond/behind superb meal. Wonderful to watch the chefs prepare the food and serve it so deftly and in a chilled way. Fish and seafood for 2021. Book early and enjoy. Fully worth the price (and get the wine pairing).
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Food is exceptional. This restaurant has some of the freshest food I have ever tasted. The meat is top quality. I highly highly recommend this restaurant.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,One of the best fine dining/tasting menu I have ever had in London. The food was very tasty and creative. They served all types of seafood that I love. The time between dishes was perfect. The portion was just right. We left the restaurant comfortably full and happy. Highly recommended
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Behind Restaurant is located in the heart of Sidworth. The waiter was impressively welcoming, knowledgeable of the menu and made expert suggestions. The food was great and really good value for money. The atmosphere of the restaurant was ‚Ä¶"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Fantastic restaurant with an amazing tasting menu and tasty wine pairing option. It is a great combination of a down-to-earth Hackney style and up market dining.

Behind Restaurant,5.0,"We enjoyed the most wonderful dinner there. It was delicious, beautifully executed, and just superb.

It's rare to have head chef so involved in service and customer care. Really nice experience!"

It's lovely to observe talented chefs create masterpiece after masterpiece using ‚Ä¶"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"One of the best fine dining experiences we've had.  the atmosphere was a perfect blend of professionalism and friendliness, elegant yet relaxed and welcoming.

Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Warm lighting and hospitality, delicious blends of taste. We indulged in their 6 course lunch tasting menu. Would highly recommend."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Service was impeccable‚Äîattentive but never intrusive. The staff were knowledgeable about the menu and happy to recommend wine pairings from their impressive selection.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Truly outstanding. Course after course all delivered by the chefs themselves (along with an excellent sommelier).
Great environment and wonderful food."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great restaurant with charming and passionate chef - great intimate experience, lovely fine dishes and superb service - one of the most lovely restaurants of London (and of East London for sure!)"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"My wife and I had truly wonderful experience at Mount Street Restaurant. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome ‚Äì their warmth, attentiveness, and professionalism really stood out and added so much to the visit.

The food was absolutely exceptional ‚Äì every dish was beautifully presented and full of rich, fresh flavours that exceeded my expectations.

What made the visit even more special was the private tour I had of the restaurant's impressive artwork collection and private dining spaces. The art pieces are stunning and thoughtfully curated, adding a unique charm to the venue.

Overall, Mount Street Restaurant offers not only outstanding food but also an unforgettable atmosphere, thanks to its amazing staff and beautiful surroundings. We can‚Äôt wait to return!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"The visit of  the Mount St. Restaurant  brought pleasure for me and my loved ones. The restaurant combines wide selection of fine arts, impressive interior design and sophisticated cuisine. Thus, the guests receive a delight for both the eyes and the palate. Two of us took the London butter lettuce salad; the Aubergine schnitzel and the Tart of caramelised onions, goat‚Äôs curd & spring vegetables. The other two tried the Aubergine schnitzel and the Orkney scallop scampi with warm tartare sauce. Everything was delicious, but the dessert really moved us and brought joy and excitement - Dark chocolate & coffee tart with roasted vanilla ice cream and Choux bun, Guernsey vanilla cream with hot chocolate sauceüòã The wine list is wide, with a predominance of more expensive wines. The service is polite and unobtrusive. Thank you for the fulfilling evening üôè"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Excellent lunch at Mount street restaurant. The scallop scampi was absolutely delicious, and the Dover sole a perfect example, sauces, seasoning, ingredients and service all spot on. Loved it and will definitely return"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Absolutely loved this place for brunch! The vibe was cozy and welcoming, and the food was top-notch. What really stood out was the service - our waitress was incredibly warm and friendly. She took the time to walk us through the British items on the menu (which we weren‚Äôt super familiar with), explaining everything in such a thoughtful and approachable way. You could tell she genuinely cared that we had a great experience. This spot is a gem!"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,A lovely restaurant on one of the prettiest streets in London. We came for dinner and of course had to try the signature lobster pie for two. The dish is pricey but does have an impressive amount of lobster inside so you won‚Äôt feel ripped off by the experience.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Truly an elevated dining experience with perhaps the best Sunday roast in London. The scallops dish was out of this world. Primo service in a beautiful setting. Highly recommended culinary experience.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Breakfast was pure decadence. The Arnold Bennett omelette was so rich and beautifully executed, it‚Äôs etched into my taste buds forever ‚Äî truly unforgettable. The d√©cor is just as remarkable: distinctive, refined, and utterly signature. Everything about the space feels curated for indulgence. A must-visit if you‚Äôre craving luxury from the very first bite of the day."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"There is a lot more to the mount steet restaurant than just the ¬£110 lobster ü¶û pie - they also have great scallop scampi, great omelette arnold bennett, great desserts, sexy salt and pepper butt plug shakers and some of the best private dinning rooms in London üá¨üáß

Make sure you add Mount street restaurant to your list of restaurants to visit"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Empirically fine in all aspects - just a bit stuffy and overpriced. I want to call it uninspired but that feels too harsh. If I remove my personal taste and expectations, it may be someone else's 5 out of 5. That said, Mount St. simply takes itself too seriously.. great place if you want to impress your partner's grandparents or want a reminder of why we've evolved past what we thought was fancy in the late 90s."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"If you love art and food, this place is for you. The walls are adorned with wonderful art and you could be fooled into thinking that you were sat in a private members club! Service is professional and attentive. The food also wonderful. Our children absolutely love breakfast here!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Celebrated a lunch birthday here and we were all very impressed by the service and food. You need to book in advance.

The lobster pie is a standout and has big prices of lobster meat, cooked in a lobster broth. It‚Äôs absolutely delicious with strong flavours.

The Sunday roast was also just as good, the beef moist, with the some of the best potatoes we‚Äôve ever had. The desserts are out of this world, and are made to order - and it shows.

Highly recommend, and would come again.

Tips:
- make sure you book in advance
- there is a 15% service charge"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Nothing but amazing things to say about our visit today.
The food was sublime
The service was amazing
The bill was damn reasonable
Special mentions to Betty and Erina for making our visit so special .
This is somewhere we will 100% be coming back to next time for dinner.
So glad I ignore some reviews on here and do my own due diligence
Happy Xmas Mount st gang London dining at its finest"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Mount Street is a beautiful location and an elegant restaurant. The art (Matisse!) is stunning and well curated but clashes with some questionable design choices like the weird table lamps or the sad ceiling. Beautiful chairs and color harmony though. Also tables for two are extremely close considering how spacious the place is.
I did have some issues during my dinner.
The infamous lobster pie was not presented on the table, just briefly shown, and poorly presented on plates. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, food wise Mount Street is very good, the lemon pie to die for, but the wine list is outrageously pricey, the fairly traditional menu too. You get Michelin star prices but not the level of creativity or perfection.
Walking through, a group of waiters were chatting with each other and didn‚Äôt even stopped or moved when I had to pass through them to get to my table! If we‚Äôre talking Mayfair prestige restaurant you would expect a much better environment sorry. After my slightly underwhelming dinner, I kept thinking that the attention to details and service are probably much higher for a certain type of customer as you can see on social media. A trend I have been used to in high end New York/ LA restaurants but it‚Äôs disappointing to see in London."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We had an amazing dinner tonight at Mount St. restaurant. The food was fantastic as were the cocktails and wine list. While the restaurant is great for a small group of adults (they have larger private rooms), or a date with another, we had our children with us and were happy to see they had a children‚Äôs menu (many restaurants in Mayfair don‚Äôt) and welcomed us. Our server, Betty, was lovely. She and her colleagues provided us the best service we have had at a London restaurant. The art on the walls was great to look at too. A great scene of people in Mayfair. We hope to be back soon."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Book in advance and enjoy going up the stairs to the art filled room. Have a Mount St Martini or Smoky Penicillin cocktail while admiring the walls. The croquettes and the beef will delight with perfect execution. The service is on point. I'd say pretty flawless experience. The restaurant is also a great choice on Mayfair for a Sunday roast where everything is excellent.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We hosted a corporate event here last month in The Swiss Room - Let me pass on my thanks to Katie for all of her help in the planning and prep for this event - from the initial meeting and show-round to the actual event yesterday, I felt confident that the event would be a success!
My boss said the food, the wine and the company was all perfect, which is exactly the feedback I would have wanted!
A special thank you to Julie, we actually said if we were hosting another event with yourselves (which we would love to do!) we would specifically request her, we really appreciated the service and how every request we had was seen to.

It's always nice to get lovely feedback not only from the host but also the guests, and everyone has been in contact to rave about the location, the service and the food/drinks.

I think the artwork also went down very well, it was a great talking point and everyone really appreciated the beautiful surroundings!

Thank you very much."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"I had the chance to badge into this restaurant recommended to me by a friend, and it was excellent with the food, hospitality, and the environment.

The food was exceptional with a touch of British culture - the food was well garnished with richness in flavour .

Hospitality was top notch, which exceeded my expectations with friendly but attentive staff commencing my entry with a smile and warmth welcome vibes.

And come to think of it, the environment was clean, the ambience was perfect either for a date, birthdays, anniversaries or any other vital occasions.

Overall, I will say Mount Restaurant was a great place i had experience in the UK."
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"We had a crab crumpet, lobster pie with veggies, and chocolate mousse. Lobster pie especially was tasty with big chunks of lobster meat. Crab crumpet was just fine nothing special."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"WOWZA if you fancy a delicious dinner then you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Big shout to the omelette, the lobster pie, the sole, the wellington (and the truffle mash with that). Just all amazing guys I can‚Äôt quite believe it xxxx"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Service was wonderful, staff were all very welcoming and polite. Bread and butter was served on the house. Ordered the signature lobster pie and was not disappointed, pastry was thin and lobster meat was generous. It‚Äôs very filling for just two people actually. Would probably be perfect sharing amongst three and having some other sides or small plates. Had a crab salad which was on the pricier side for its size (of a palm). Overall great central location and atmosphere for a business lunch."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Mount St. Restaurant ‚Äì Review by Alex

Had a brilliant time at Mount St. Restaurant. The d√©cor is stunning ‚Äî feels more like an art gallery than a restaurant, with original pieces from big names like Warhol and Freud. Every detail, from the mosaic floors to the designer chairs, adds to the experience.

The food really impressed me. I had the mock turtle croquette to start, which was rich and flavourful. The lobster pie for two stole the show ‚Äî dramatic presentation and packed with taste. Dessert was the rhubarb custard soft-serve, simple but full of nostalgia.

Drinks were just as good ‚Äî the wine list is massive, and staff helped me choose the perfect red to match the meal. Pricey, but definitely worth it for a special night"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"This restaurant was arguably one of the best restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to. Went there with my girlfriend and we really had a great time. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was great and also the service was amazing. I highly recommend it especially if you are going on a date or etc."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"fantastic dining spot! Everything exceeded our expectations. We were pleasantly surprised by the lively atmosphere (good crowd)‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt often find in Mayfair. The food was exceptional; the lobster pie was a standout, and the banana souffl√© became my instant favorite. Aesthetically, the restaurant is incredibly chic, with its impressive artwork and creative interior design. Oh, and The service! You definitely feel welcomed as staff is super attentive.
I would gladly return!"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,Classic English menu but in a beautiful setting with art and friendly service at @mountstrestaurant in Mayfair.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"I had an exceptional dining experience at Mount St. Restaurant. The ambiance was sophisticated and intimate, with a beautifully designed interior that exuded elegance. The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff who were knowledgeable about the menu. The food was exquisite, with each dish expertly prepared and presented. The steak was cooked to perfection, and the wine pairing was impressive. While the prices may be on the higher side, it's well worth it for a special occasion. I would highly recommend Mount St. Restaurant to anyone seeking a refined dining experience."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We came here to try the famous lobster pie and weren't disappointed. In fact every element of our meal was superbly crafted, from my ""strawberries and cream"" seabass starter down to the cherry kirsch sponge dessert. And obviously, the showstopper pie, was perfectly cooked and presented. The pastry was buttery and flaky without being dry, and the filling was quite generously portioned with chunks of fresh lobster. It comes with some delicious veg (broad beans, cavolo nero) but we also got some mash on the side which was buttery and smooth. It was perfectly accompanied by a lovely bottle of Chardonnay. The service was attentive and the environment with its dim lighting and artworks was second to none. A real treat."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We found this place while looking for something near by but didn‚Äôt realize what a lovely place it was! The staff was very friendly and the food was perfect! I had the lamb, perfectly cooked, and paired with a zucchini flower that was stuffed. My youngest had an onion tart with mushrooms and beans.

The restaurant was designed by an artist so that it looks like you are eating in an art gallery!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,My favourite restaurant! Probably the best chips in London!
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Booked the Italian rooms for a special Birthday. Lounge and Dining room. Dining Room is suitable for a party of up to 12 guests.
Stefania my contact at the restaurant was very professional which made specific arrangements easy to organise (I got a tour around the restaurant prior to the night I booked).
The ambience and service is excellent and all my guests thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The food was tasty but I wouldn't call it exceptional- that's not saying it was bad in any way. I'd recommend ordering more side dishes, they were quite small and 6 between 12 was barely enough.
The Beef Wellington was beautifully rare and the Butter Lettuce salad was incredibly tasty.
To get the rooms you will need to spend a minimum of ¬£1500 which is not difficult. Deposit is that amount prior to event.
I think this is a cashless restaurant too."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"I recently visited Mount St. Restaurant and had a wonderful experience. The atmosphere is elegant and welcoming, with a beautifully designed interior that feels both modern and classic.

The service was excellent ‚Äî the staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered a steak with seasonal sides, and everything was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. The wine selection was also impressive, with many great options to choose from.

Prices are on the higher side, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it for a special occasion. I would highly recommend Mount St. Restaurant to anyone looking for high-quality food and top-tier service"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Wedding dinner for 15 at the Scottish Room. Food was excellent and service was phenomenal. The team was non-intrusive but keenly attentive - a difficult balance. They went above and beyond in a number of ways. We greatly appreciated everything and would highly recommend for important private family events.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"A beautiful, multi level restaurant with an art focus. The menu is classic but varied, with various caviar, oyster, seafood and meat options. Highlights for us were the lobster pie and beef Wellington.
The beetroot tart was technically well curated but not especially exciting.
Their souffl√© was perfectly made and the chocolate mousse is both airy and rich.
The restaurant itself is worth a visit for the building alone- an old building with interesting and striking art. I love the recipe pieces in the corridor.
Definitely worth trying if you're visiting London and want a Mayfair dining experience, without the pretentiousness of a lot of Mayfair spots, a bit old school, with creative interior. Yet the staff were very sweet and welcoming."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Upstairs at this restaurant is simply stunning, filled with an artistic atmosphere. Surrounded by world-famous paintings, the ambiance is extremely comfortable. Highly recommend for art and food lovers!

üçÉ Located on Mount Street in Mayfair, this restaurant, owned by a gallery owner, features works by Matisse, Picasso, Philip Guston, George Condo, and more. You‚Äôll be amazed by the art and the delicious British cuisine.

üôå Every dish is a delight! The bread with butter and chicken liver p√¢t√© is a must-try, as well as the London butter lettuce salad with blue cheese, pear, and candied walnuts. The beef tartare is one of the best in London, and the Dressed Portland crab salad is a summer specialty.

ü•∞ Desserts are French-inspired with British names, like the classic Eton Mess turned into a cake mousse ‚Äì not too sweet, just perfect!

ü´∂ Definitely a spot I can‚Äòt wait to revisit!"
Mount St. Restaurant,2.0,"Welcome from the senior staff member was a tad snotty, guy on the front door and our waiter were very nice. Loved the art work and floor. Food was decidely average at best - I would not recommend the beef tartare (I requested no egg yolk - it arrived as requested (fine) completely garnish free - quite uninspiring and beef was tasteless, toast waa greasy.. The monkfish dish was not great - I was playing find the potato - finally found four or five tiny balls hiding in the sauce.  The sauce was not well balanced. For the price I was expecting something amazing. I  have eaten much better for much less and don't think I would return."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We had an excellent dinner last night, notable points: the ambience is very elegant, with all the wonderful pieces of art but very relaxed. The cocktails taste great. The wine list is very pricey. The food was delivered to perfection. We picked salads for starters (wonderful taste!) just to have room for the beef Wellington that came perfectly executed and the velvety mash that is a dream. Extra note, as I mentioned that we are celebrating a special occasion during my reservation -being early valentine‚Äôs dinner- they asked us what the celebration was about during dessert and presented us with a lovely chocolate cake. The service is outstanding in all aspects and I would recommend to anyone looking for a good English menu in London"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Superb restaurant all round. Went for Sunday lunch - buzzy atmosphere, great mix of people.

We‚Äôd eaten elsewhere before so just ordered the Lobster pie which was the primary reason for the visit. It delivered. It was full of lobster and perfectly executed.

Everything else was super. Even the Diet Coke came with a metal straw in wonderful glassware with a great amount of ice (subjective I know).

Water was charged at ¬£1.75 per head for unlimited which is a nicer touch than ¬£8 a bottle elsewhere‚Ä¶"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Probably one of the best London restaurants been to where the service is excellent.  Having not decided on the drinks,  told the waiter give us a few min.  And he actually come back in a few min not 15-20 minü§£ thoughtout the all the staff were excellent and the food looks and taste excellent.  Ordered 2 beef wellingtons and the lamb,  Plus sides. Definitely would recommend and return."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Honestly one of the best places I‚Äôve been too will definitely be going again.. never had better service than this place.. thinking about doing my birthday here as the food was exceptional and the staff were great
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic dining experience. The atmosphere was cozy yet elegant, the service was attentive, and every dish was a standout‚Äîfrom the flavorful appetizers to the perfectly cooked main course and decadent dessert. You can tell they care deeply about quality and presentation. Highly recommended‚ÄîI‚Äôll definitely return!"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Interesting dinner. Honestly the art was lost on me as not a personal interest of mine. Service was fantastic with very attentive waiters, smartly dressed and very well informed. Food was average for the price paid. Dishes lacked innovation and substance. Whilst being excatly as advertised you would expect some more complex flavour profiles given the simplicity of the dishes which they didn't have. Personally a 4 star meal. Probably wouldn't return as felt the cost didn't justify the dinning experience. Atmosphere was nice although it did get very loud during the meal making it hard to hear dinner guests, not a easy place to talk with the volume."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We came for a birthday lunch today with our 2 year old. The waitstaff couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating (I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt get their names), they were phenomenal.  We had some issues but they sorted everything out quickly. The food was delicious and the restaurant is beautiful (the ART, my god the ART!). Would definitely return."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,A warm and welcoming place where every detail feels thoughtfully crafted from the comforting aroma that greets you at the door to the genuine smiles that make you feel like part of the family. The food isn‚Äôt just delicious; it tells a story on every plate.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Great traditional English breakfast in a beautiful setting. Such a privilege to dine surrounded by the beautiful artworks. Service was top notch.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,üëç Book in advance and enjoy going up the stairs to the art filled room. Have a Mount St Martini or Smoky Penicillin cocktail while admiring the walls. The croquettes and the beef will delight with perfect execution. The service is on point. I'd say pretty flawless experience. The restaurant is also a great choice on Mayfair for a Sunday roast where everything is excellent.
Mount St. Restaurant,3.0,"Mount Street is a beautiful location and an elegant restaurant. The art (Matisse!) is stunning and well curated but clashes with some questionable design choices like the weird table lamps or the sad ceiling. Beautiful chairs and color harmony though. Also tables for two are extremely close considering how spacious the place is.
I did have some issues during my dinner.
The infamous lobster pie was not presented on the table, just briefly shown, and poorly presented on plates. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, food wise Mount Street is very good, the lemon pie to die for, but the wine list is outrageously pricey, the fairly traditional menu too. You get Michelin star prices but not the level of creativity or perfection.
Walking through, a group of waiters were chatting with each other and didn‚Äôt even stopped or moved when I had to pass through them to get to my table! If we‚Äôre talking Mayfair prestige restaurant you would expect a much better environment sorry. After my slightly underwhelming dinner, I kept thinking that the attention to details and service are probably much higher for a certain type of customer as you can see on social media. A trend I have been used to in high end New York/ LA restaurants but it‚Äôs disappointing to see in London."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"The food is absolutely amazing and worth every penny, along with great professional service throughout the evening. with a friendly and chilled atmosphere I will definitely return."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Central London. It is located in Mayfair, above the Audley Public House, which is also well worth a visit (for a drink or two). This was the 2nd time I dined at the Mount St. Restaurant, and I had the lobster pie (shared with my mother). It's a great dish, worth every penny (¬£96)."
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"We came for Sunday lunch and the interior of the restaurant is beautiful. We shared the lobster pie for two which is quite expensive for ¬£96 but it was filling and had a generous amount of lobster in it. It is rich but tasty. The side of greens it came with was slightly undercooked and quite average and we also got mash on the side which complimented well with the pie. The cocktail was nice but it was ¬£18, so it's on the more expensive side. Staff were polite, courteous and attentive at all times."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Amazing Atmosphere & Food. Can only recommend. The LobsterPie - just brill! Enjoy & thank me later!
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Certainly worth it if you're craving their incredible lobster pie ‚Äì delicious and generously packed with lobster. The side dishes were also incredible. However, the starters didn't quite meet expectations in my opinion."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Great quality & Super child friendly!

So after we were turned down at Scott‚Äôs I was not sure if we find something to eat with our kids in this area. Then we just saw Mount St. Restaurant and asked if they have a table.
Fortunately they did and it was the best decision ever.

The staff is very welcoming (quite a difference to Scott‚Äôs) and child friendly. They‚Äòve even got some wachs colors for the boys. They also have a kids menu. Pasta was very well made.

The adult food was 100 out of 100. Dorado with morels - just awesome. The desserts were also very delicious. On top they had our
Favorite Louis Roederer Rose open. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Service was just outstanding and the staff was very Child friendly!

Thanks a lot, this was our greatest unplanned restaurant experience in London so far! And as a foodie visited multiple Michelin starred restaurants, I know what I talk about!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Absolutely love the food here. The taste is amazing and portions are decent. Reasonable price as well! Nothing to complain about this place. 100% recommended!
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Absolutely amazing! I loved the ambiance of the place as well as the food. the entrance of the resturant is interesting as it is inside of the pub,  inside the building and take the elevator up but they do have an outside entrance with stairs. . The decor was amazing , if you know art very well you will recognise  who the
salt and pepper shakers are by. The tables were nicely spaced out and comfortable. The food was really amazing. The cocktails were very maturely presented and  were flavoured with best alcohol.   We tried many things from the menu and they each came with a really well made presentation, our favourite was the rib eye stake they got medium well done  right ! which most restaurants  do it burnt ! and the  souffl√© desert is best.  I would highly recommend this place as a dining experience, if you are looking for a mayfair  contemporary art experience. Would say it‚Äôs more suitable for couples or small groups. Even the bathroom was amazing. The considerations for the entire experience could be felt in every step. not too pretentious."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of the Fife Arms, and was thrilled by my first visit to Mount St. Restaurant today. Loved the lobster pie! One of those rare dishes that I will find myself remembering from time to time.

Excellent souffl√©. Wonderful staff who gave us a little art tour, as we were the first to arrive for lunch service. Looking forward to many more visits!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Fantastic food and experience. The harmony of flavors and textures was truly expectional a perfect 10üòçthe staff was very friendly and warm.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Me and my girlfriend recently visited this restaurant.And trust me, the food was so amazing.And the service they  provided was absolutely outstanding.I have really the food and Would recommend anybody who wants to have a lovely time and enjoy the lovely food"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,British deliciousness in every bite. The kind of menu that will make me want to go back. Plenty of vegetarian dishes. Lovely staff. Highly recommend.
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"Nice art and really excellent service, but food and particularly the lobster pie was kind of mid"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, with a warm and welcoming ambiance. The staff was attentive and friendly, ensuring we were comfortable throughout the meal. The menu offered a variety of options, catering to different dietary preferences.

The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor. The appetizers were fresh and well-seasoned, setting the tone for the rest of the meal. The main course was cooked to perfection, with generous portions and a great balance of textures. Dessert was a highlight, with a rich and indulgent selection that left us wanting more.

Overall, it was a delightful dining experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality food and excellent service."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"A newish addition to the neighbourhood. I question if it is a restaurant or more of a canteen. Not been previously because friend of mine didn‚Äôt like. The food is very good with wonderful sauces and delightful whipped pots of dressing and dips. I had the crab with fresh lettuce. Then the lobster pie and apple crumble souffl√©. The pudding was the best. Flavours divine. The crab light and fresh. The pie an interesting idea - I love pie at the Holborn dining rooms and lobster is a firm favourite (I visit the usa a lot) but lobster pie? The pastry was delicious, the lobster divine. Do they go together? I don‚Äôt think so. However virtually every table was ordering it. (They do have beef wellington - but my companion didn‚Äôt eat beef - shame!) I found the restaurant noisy - one table of 8 was laughing loudly - it got better when the room filled up more. I hear breakfast and lunch are very good so perhaps those are the better time options."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"We had the pleasure of working with Megan Lockhart for our high-calibre event, and she was absolutely fantastic. She went above and beyond to ensure everything ran seamlessly, demonstrating incredible attention to detail and professionalism.

Megan was always available, super helpful, and truly made the entire process stress-free. We couldn't have asked for a better events manager and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for an expert to elevate their event. Thank you Megan!"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Really good food and lovely staff tasty drinks a fancy place for a date but everything is spot on the atmosphere is so wonderful I really recommend it
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,It was really nice and the food there was tempting and delicious I enjoyed it a lot as well as my family I would surely recommend it!!
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"A really exceptional experience my first at this restaurant for lunch not long after opening. I came here following a review from the critic for the Evening Standard and wasn't disappointed.

Some restaurants can be a tricky when newly opened as they settle in to find their niche, but it's clear that the fine details have been taken care of here across both food, decor and service.

The menu is a mix of British classics with inspiration from traditional French menus but manages to combine fine dining with a genuine kind of 'homeliness' to the food and carries off both contrasting elements well. The luxury ingredients are complemented by generous portion sizes for a restaurant in this local. Generosity is abundant elsewhere in the menu e.g. including a truly delicious chicken parfait with caramelised shallots alongside the usual fare of bread and salted butter.

The Arnold Bennett omelette was as good as any I've had elsewhere in London. While the pigeons in pimlico main was itself a stand out, the addition of bubble and squeak as a side was a true elevation about the usual chips or pur√©e potatoes.

The attention to detail that has been paid to the art on the walls (including originals by Lucian Freude and Matisse among others) is clearly more than just a gimic as the wider decor makes for a very comfortable relaxed dining experience but with the care attention that has gone into the design running throughout and always clear. If I was to nitpick the tiniest of details the only downside was sharing the rest rooms with The Audley Pub below in the basement meant breaking the ambience environment when going there as they were clearly styled to match The Audley more than the restaurant.

This restaurant is clearly carving out a niche in the upper end of the market (but distinct from your usual Michelin type places) and with that comes a cost but although pricey my opinion was that for the quality of food, service, ambience and above all location the menu was good value for money.

Above all I was extremely impressed by the service. Ondrej is a real credit to the restaurant and based on his knowledge and enthusiasm for the entire area, I'd also add to the hospitality industry as a whole. The enthusiasm from all staff was clear and they seemed genuinely delighted to be working there which isn't always the case even when it appears to be.

A testament to how much I rated my first experience despite the restaurant having only been open for a few weeks I have already booked my second visit and can see this becoming a regular favourite."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"This is constructive criticism.
Ambience: Cosy, lively, romantic, comfortable, and relaxed.
Food: we'll prepare, fleuret, visually appealing.
Staff.: Friendly, helpful, Efficient. Friendly, knowledgeable, efficient."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Truly amazing ! Delicious food and lovely atmosphere. The service was lovely and attentive. Highly recommend.
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Honestly one of the best restaurants I have ever been to, everything was done to perfection. Highly recommend."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,"Was absolutely blown away by the food, service, and the art! If you are an art enthusiast of any kind, you should come not only for their cleanly cooked bream and modern take on a beet salad, but their extensive collection of paintings and drawings courtesy of Hauser & Wirth (a blue chip gallery).

The Art: The Paris-based interior design is full of fun facts, from repeating wallpaper printed with a Paul McCarthy statue to the hand-collaged Phyllida Barlow ceiling installed next door at The Audrey Bar (owned by the same people). You will find Fontana, Freud, and Hodler on the walls among many other well curated picks!

Everything else: the food is clean, well portioned, and flavorful with Parisian influences. They accommodated gluten, dairy, and nut allergies for our group with no problem, and our server took the time to explain some of the art collection to us despite it being a busy Friday night. Thank you for a lovely, lovely experience!"
Mount St. Restaurant,4.0,"The food quality has declined. The Sunday brunch Yorkshire pudding was burnt, and the food was served cold. While the service is friendly, the execution in the kitchen needs improvement."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,I loved this restaurant! Such a cool vibe in a quiet neighborhood. The food was excellent and came out very quickly.
Mount St. Restaurant,1.0,"Food was good, ambiente is also pretty nice, but the ‚Äûoptional 15% service charge was automatically added‚Äú is what put me off completely. This is an almost american standard of deception."
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Brilliant lobster pie with a side of greens and top notch service.
Mount St. Restaurant,2.0,"The receptionist ‚Äì a British senior ‚Äònot‚Äìso‚Äìgentleman‚Äô ‚Äì set the tone for the evening with a snobbish and rude attitude. You‚Äôd feel more welcome at a local caf√©! Not exactly the warm, polished service you‚Äôd expect ‚Äì and certainly not the best way to start a meal.

(The only good service in the entire place was from our waiter Bartosz!)"
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Great Breakfast spot. Haven't done dinner but sure it won't disappoint
Mount St. Restaurant,5.0,Great menu and good service. Kind people who take care of your experience and cook with love!
Fallow,5.0,"Ate at Fallow last night. Believe the hype, it‚Äôs very good. We were served by Christian, he is an excellent ambassador for the business. His knowledge of the menu and his advice on dishes were really helpful.
The food is innovative, beautiful and tastes amazing. We ate some of the famous dishes, corn ribs, mushroom parfait, cod‚Äôs head and they were all excellent.
A very decent wine list and good cocktails to get things going."
Fallow,5.0,"Went to Fallow twice recently. Was very happy both times. Food was great, service was excellent & atmosphere pretty good as a whole. I was particularly impressed with their head to tail choice of ingredients. Mindful some may find part of the menu too adventurous, it will surely satisfy those who are more used to a greater choice of ingredients or who are open to something more exotic or different. The best dishes in my first visit were Cod‚Äôs Head, mushroom parfait & corn ribs. I also like octopus crumpet & beef tartare. The only dish I found not as good as some I had tried before was possibly beef ribs. Second time I tried their roasted pig‚Äôs head. It was quite an experience. We were very impressed with the way how this pretty unthinkable giant of a dish was executed, served & tasted. I do have to give a warning though the dish is pretty fatty & filling. It will be a good idea to share it amongst at least 4 people if not six."
Fallow,5.0,Really good lunch on a Sunday. We had the roast beef with a side of cauliflower and broccoli cheese which was awesome. The cod‚Äôs head lived up to all expectations and I‚Äôd highly recommend. Chips on the side to mop up all the amazing sauce was a win. We were super full at the end but the sweetcorn ice cream was too good to say no to. Definitely retuning here.
Fallow,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant restaurant, would highly recommend.

We had the beef ribs, corn ribs and cod‚Äôs head with fries. The corn ribs were outstanding and the beef ribs were excellent. The cod‚Äôs head was very good also especially with the addition of the fries, though it does take 5-10 minutes to get over the fact that it is, in fact, a big cod‚Äôs head on your plate!

Our server Josh C was polite, attentive and helpful with menu suggestions and we enjoyed a brief chat at the end of the meal about Fallow and the sister restaurants, Fowl and Roe, Which are next on my list to visit!

They were also kind enough to provide us with a complementary dessert to share in celebration of our anniversary, which was very much appreciated."
Fallow,5.0,"Literally the best restaurant experience I have had. The staff were very attentive to the point where they were topping up our water and changing the empty bottles without us noticing.

The food was spectacular. Every element was perfectly balanced and looked beautiful! The hardest part was seeing diners order other dishes and having food envy. Out of everything I tried the Chelsea tart really stole the show.

I will definitely be back again!"
Fallow,5.0,"Tried Fallow for the first time and got the Corn ribs, mushroom parfait and cod head. All three were very good but my favourite has to be the mushroom parfait. I also recommend sitting at the kitchen bar as it was very entertaining watching the team operate in such as fast paced environment. Special shout out to Isabella who was my server for the night. She provided excellent recommendations and went above and beyond in terms of the level of care. Thanks to the entire team for a great first dinner in London!"
Fallow,5.0,"Visited here by myself spontaneously for my birthday without booking, was bit busy but luckily got the bar seat which is good for the solo diner.
The corn rib was a bit tricky to eat well but i loved the seasoning and steak was very soft and tasty. And also i got the Tomato Salad and it was really good with the cheese and crunchy something.
Server named Jack was very friendly and all the other servers were so nice and caring any inconvenience or how the food is, and i loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. Of course it‚Äôs in central London so was but pricy but recommended to spend your day on special occasion."
Fallow,5.0,"Excellent service, innovative dishes and cocktails, always lovely coming here and I don't think there's anything on the menu that I wouldn't try/haven't tried that was less than amazing. Took my mum a few days ago, and even though she normally neither drinks cocktails nor eats anything smoked, she loved her rhubarb spritz and was sorely tempted to lick the plate of her ribs clean.  I love that everything is so well thought through and rounded, and that there are so many small dishes to share, because, truly, you just want to try everything from this spectacular menu. Big shout out to the amazing waiters and waitresses as well, who are all very lovely and attentive! Always a good and special night out!"
Fallow,5.0,"This was such a superb restaurant, our waiter, Thomas, gave us excellent recommendations from the very beginning and provided us with top tier service throughout the evening. The food was excellent, there was not a single dish we had anything but praise for! The corn ribs and mushroom parfait are both must have dishes. Sitting at the chefs counter was incredibly fun, getting to watch your food being made and seeing the energy of the kitchen made for a really cool atmosphere that you only get by having the kitchen be ‚Äúcentre stage‚Äù in the restaurant space."
Fallow,5.0,"Stellar experience overall from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. Each staff member we interacted with was lovely and so attentive. Our server Tomos, did an excellent job reviewing our selections and ensuring we had the perfect amount of food for our group of 7 adults and one child. Wine and water were frequently filled, plates were cleared and exchanged as soon as needed. This is a family style service so I think it‚Äôs best enjoyed in a group to get to experience as much as possible. I also want to call out the exceptional service at the front desk. We ordered around 5 starter/small plates and three entrees and two sides and shared the sweet corn dessert. Mushroom parfait, sourdough bread, burrata, short ribs, duck pancake; cod‚Äôs head, tandoori cauliflower, rib eye, potatoes and cabbage; cocktails and wine; sweet corn soft serve. Our server heavily recommended the mushroom parfait and the person who doesn‚Äôt like mushrooms in the group even agreed it was fantastic. I think my overall favorite was the duck pancake. Absolutely fantastic and a brilliant experience."
Fallow,5.0,"Visited Fallow for dinner to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary. The food was unreal. Best bites were: corn ribs, mushroom parfait, and the fallow burger. Akira was a friendly, attentive and professional server. Our table was great too, right by the window for some good people-watching on Haymarket. Highly recommended for a delicious and indulgent meal."
Fallow,4.0,"Great attentive service, starters came out super quick. Kitchen bar seats were a great view. Non alcoholic cocktails were delicious.

Corn ribs 8/10 yummy but something I could easily recreate at home

Mushroom parfait 8.5/10. Lovely flavour, great bread

Beef ribs 9/10 lovely BBQ char flavour, fall off the bone tender

Chicken roast 8/10 huge portion of meat. Enough for 2 people. Potatoes nice and crispy, side veg were all very good. Nice savory gravy

Cods head, 7.5/10 fish was very fresh and cooked well but needed more seasoning, sauce was a bit one note and got a bit boring. Needed more of a kick. Lots of meat on the head.

Chips 8/10 same flavouring as the corn, nice and crispy

Salted corn soft serve 9/10 lovely balance of sweet, savory crunchy.

All very good generous sized portions"
Fallow,5.0,"The food was straight way amazing. One of the best things I have had in a while. The corn rips are a perfect start, the mushroom parfait is so rich in flavor and the miso eggplant really just super delicious. As a dessert I can really recommend the sweet corn - heaven!"
Fallow,5.0,"We had a great dinner at Fallow last week before our theater show. Shout out to our server Toby who was attentive, knowledgeable, and helped us pick out some really tasty dishes. The vibes are great for a date or with a group of friends. Everything tasted great - highlights were the rhubarb cocktail, mushroom toast (divine!), and cod head with chips. Would definitely return!"
Fallow,5.0,"Great ambience! Great food! My husband follows their YouTube channel and we wanted to visit on our trip to London!

The corn ribs are a must order! Beef short ribs were delicious! Everything was cooked to perfection
Sweet corn brown butter soft serve was also exceptional !

Want to go back to try their cod‚Äôs head

Staff was also friendly, reservations are really recommended as they get busy !"
Fallow,5.0,"I booked a seat for one and was placed at the bar, where I loved the vibes. The staff were incredibly nice, and the service was exceptional. Every dish I tried was delightful!

The mushroom parfait was surprisingly good, and the crispy corn seasoning was delicious. The ribs were tender and juicy, and the sauce elevated them to another level. Lastly, the beef fillet was one of the best I've had, complemented perfectly by the accompanying sauces."
Fallow,5.0,"Our waiter was super friendly, and we absolutely loved everything we ordered!
We highly recommend the beef ribs and the corn rice dessert. Outstanding! The ribs were super savory and juicy while the dessert was creamy and tasty.
There was a small band that came and sang to us for a while: it was lovely!
It's not a cheap place, but it is worth it!!
Super recommendable place"
Fallow,5.0,"What a great experience. After watching a number of YouTube  reviews over the past few months, we had high expectations, these were not only met but exceeded. We were here for a Sunday lunch, from the very moment we entered the service was professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The cocktails were incredible especially the gin rhubarb one.

We had the corn ribs and beef ribs as a starter, the amount of flavour in both was incredible.

The Sunday roast was the best I have had,  the beef had so much flavour, complimented by the perfectly cooked vegetables.

We do not normally have desert, however shared the rhubarb and ginger cheesecake, again incredible combinations of flavour.

Overall a great experience of high quality food, in a relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely be back, next time we are in London.

A big thanks to all the staff."
Fallow,2.0,"For the tourists: This place is a disappointment. It's overhyped and the reviews are flooded by locals who raise the overall score of the restaurant. Please do not visit.

Food:
The execution is really not good. This is despite all the social media hype, all the technique they showcase. The beef ribs lack body, the potato waffle cheese sauce lacks body as well and has this slight bitterness which wasn't good. The mushroom parfait was absolutely delicious, it's got great depth of flavour and complexity. Apparently it's a 3-4day process and it shows, the bread was good too.

The fallow burger was sad. Despite the nduja, the overall burger tastes so bland. The pickles were so mild, and the candied bacon was terrible.

Chelsea tart was good, however the milk ice cream was too mild. And the tart was too salty

Service: they were very annoyed with us ordering a few dishes at once, but they mentioned from the start that the food comes as and when. It's very confusing why they have a problem with it and they keep telling us it slows down the kitchen, which made no sense when they're not a fine dining place that has to ensure everything coming at once. They keep harping on it without properly explaining why. There was one nice lady who was in charge of us though

Atmosphere: Very packed and rowdy and tight place"
Fallow,5.0,"We had a wonderful experience at Fallow. This was my second time in London, first time at this restaurant and our waiter Tomos made us feel very welcome and right at home. He was super friendly and thoughtful. We even received a small anniversary dessert. The food was great, every dish was unique and delicious in its own way. We would recommend dining at the chef‚Äôs counter but you‚Äôll need to make a reservation. The staff in the kitchen were extremely hard working and professional.  A well oiled machine with an eye for detail and hygiene. It was a great evening ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you Fallow staff!"
Fallow,5.0,"After watching YouTube videos from Fallow for months, when I had a trip to London planned I could not have been more excited. I walked in with high expectations and they were all met or  exceeded.

The service was some of the best I had ever had. Every item of food that hit our table was excellent. Both the corn and beef ribs were delicious...the corn in a way I couldn't have expected. The tartare and mushrooms were great. Even my kids dinner were wonderful. And the desserts...its tough to know what to say. The caramelized whey tart is not something I'm easily able to describe. Think a pie filled with caramel, but not as heavy and with an amazing texture. The brown butter ice cream changed the way I envision the possibilities of ice cream.

I cannot recommend Fallow highly enough. We've even considered a return trip to London simply for a show and dinner here."
Fallow,4.0,"We tried the corn ribs, beef ribs, mushroom parfait, cod head, Rhubarb & Custard cocktail, and Mandarin Mimosa cocktail. The mushroom parfait was our absolute favourite‚Äîrich and full of flavour! The corn ribs were also delicious. The cod head was definitely an interesting dish, but well worth trying.

A big thank you to Anna, who served our table‚Äîshe was thoughtful, attentive, and gave us excellent food recommendations throughout the meal."
Fallow,5.0,Fallow is amazing. Retirement and anniversary breakfast celebration did not disappoint! Service was very attentive from the minute you walked in. Set at the chef‚Äôs table which was entertaining and intriguing. Breakfast croissant was so tasty and put together beautifully. Hash browns were crispy and fluffy all in the same bite. Restaurant was spotless and it is obvious to see why Fallow has such a good reputation. Would like to return for lunch on another visit.
Fallow,5.0,"Really wonderful restaurant. So happy I decided to pop in for early dinner. They accommodated me even though I was without reservation and dining alone. I gotta say my server Josh C. Had some amazing recommendations, the mushroom mousse was a must try! Thanks for that one! The duck pancake was my fav for sure. Really amazing and the staff were very genuine and seemed to love the work. If you can check it out, you MUST!"
Fallow,5.0,"Very tasty food with bar seating at Fallow on a Sunday eve. Jack, our waiter, went above and beyond to recommend his favorite dishes and we even got some compliments from the kitchen and bar staff, which was very unexpected and kind. Recommend for some British bites from a kitchen and bar staff that has craftsmanship."
Fallow,5.0,"I just had one of the most incredible dining experiences in London! Every moment was a delight, thanks to the amazing food and top-notch service. Our wonderful server, Amanda, was an absolute gem, and the fantastic manager Josh, along with Rommel and sommelier Priyance, truly outdid themselves to make our meal unforgettable. They went above and beyond, especially for one of us, ensuring we felt extra special. I had such a fantastic time ‚Äì I can't wait to return the next time I'm in London!"
Fallow,5.0,"Had the opportunity to visit London for a work trip and was looking forward to dining here as a lone diner, having followed the very informative and entertaining YouTube channel for a while. Was pretty jetlagged after a long journey from Australia but managed to get a booking for a seat at the Chef's counter on a busy Wednesday evening last week. Highly recommend the experience. Food was excellent, service was attentive and expeditious. Mushroom parfait was a highlight. It was a privelege being seated right adjacent the chef's pass and watching the kitchen team work together with great speed, skill, cohesion and chemistry. It was a very busy service just after 6PM and it was a pleasure watching the head chef lead the service seamlessly with great calmness and efficiency - the communication, camaraderie, and above all, palpable joy with which the team worked was reflected in the atmosphere of the place and the quality of the dishes served. A most memorable experience and one I would hope to repeat again in the future."
Fallow,5.0,"Absolutely love Fallow!
The food is incredible‚Äîdelicious, creative, and full of surprises. They make amazing dishes using parts of ingredients that most people usually discard, and the results are impressive.
I highly recommend sitting at the chef‚Äôs counter‚Äîit‚Äôs like dinner and a show, watching the chefs in action.
Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
Fallow,5.0,"Fallow, Fallow, Fallow.. You just got everything right! From the second I walked in, I was in heaven. The staff was so friendly, full of energy, and informative. I was served by Josh and he was awesome. I felt like it was a personal experience. The food, oh my goodness. Every dish and drink I had was incredible. So well thought of and creative. All the flavors just hit and the time/effort that goes into creating these is felt. Every first bite of each dish was a wow moment for me. I encourage you to watch the videos on their Instagram and see how the dishes are created! To top it all off, this place is sustainable. From growing their own mushrooms there to repurposing their oyster shells, they make that effort to be a sustainable establishment. I left with a huge smile on my face and I cannot wait to visit again for another Fallow experience."
Fallow,5.0,"I absolutely loved the corn ribs, mushroom parfait, cod head, beef burger and Sunday roast of roasted pork. The Dragon Punch for non-alcoholic drinkers is refreshing. All yummy! üòç and we were served by Ana who was most courteous and friendly, we loved her smile üòä"
Fallow,5.0,"We sat at the Chef's Counter overlooking the kitchen which kept us entertained, and in awe, watching the chefs create mouth watering dishes. The service was exceptional and our waiter Toby was attentive, charming and knowledgeable on both the food and wine. They also surprised us with dessert for our anniversary which was very special. My favourite dish was the burrata and my husband's was the cod's head. We can't wait to visit again."
Fallow,5.0,"Had a wonderful experience while celebrating our anniversary here. The service was friendly and all staff were incredibly welcoming. The sparkler was a nice touch! The food was good but not outstanding; the salmon croissant roll was tasty but nothing memorable, the mushroom toast was very flavourful, thanks to the wild garlic pesto, though the broccoli on it felt a bit out of place. My favorite was the blueberry cake with poppyseed crumble which was delicious. Would definitely be coming back to try lunch/dinner."
Fallow,5.0,4 people - we ordered 15 food items and some drinks. EVERYTHING was amazing! Seasoned to limit but not over. Outstanding cooking techniques. Crazy good service. Best restaurant without a star I have ever been. Absolutely worth going there!!!
Fallow,3.0,"While most of the food was exceptionally good, the burgers were remarkably dull, 2/5, buns weren't great, meat was dry, you can get a MUCH better burger from Five Guys/Honest Burger. Just avoid the burgers and you'll be fine.
Overall, great food, excellent drinks, but average value for money. The service was very good."
Fallow,4.0,"The food at Fallow Restaurant was very good. Highlights included the corn ribs and the black cod head, which were amazing. However, the service lacked attention and forgot the birthday celebration."
Fallow,5.0,"Just had the most amazing Sunday lunch!  Seriously, everything was perfect.  Started with the corn ribs and duck pancakes, which were both incredible. Then we went for the full roast and wow, just wow. So much delicious food, perfectly cooked. Definitely going back for more soon. Highly recommend checking this place out if you can! Best Sunday lunch I've had in ages.

It was my birthday and they even brought out a sparkler with the desserts"
Fallow,5.0,"Faultless food and perfect service - thank you Aston for the excellent explanations and guidance! We were a party of 3 and shared the mushroom parfait, beef ribs (we had two portions), octopus muffin, corn ribs, aubergine, tomato salad and sourdough bread. Standouts were the mushroom parfait and the aubergine - just stunning. We thought it couldn't get better and then we shared the Rhubarb mousse and Chelsea Tart - unanimously, the two best desserts we had ever had. I will be dreaming about the food and looking forward to my next visit."
Fallow,5.0,"Second time coming to Fallow, this time for mine and my boyfriend‚Äôs 2 year anniversary. He‚Äôs been a few times and is absolutely in love with the place, as am I! We were served by Manisha who was attentive, friendly and gave us two drinks on the house, and made us feel really looked after. She made the evening! All the food was gorgeous - Jack was in the kitchen, and we were lucky enough to meet and thank him, he was really friendly and down to earth. The whole kitchen and service team are brilliant. Truly amazing. I‚Äôll always come back to Fallow!"
Fallow,5.0,"Incredible food that lives up to the hype, the mushroom parfait is delicious. What really made this a special experience however was the service from Vivian - genuinely the kindest, warmest service we have EVER had. She was so charismatic and made our anniversary lunch so memorable. Give that girl a raise x"
Fallow,5.0,"Great food and staff. The corn ribs were definitely special. The oysters are served with delicious shallots and their special sriracha which was fire. The mushroom parfait was really rich. The duck pancake was really great too. Finally, the burger was really rich and beefy. I would say it is not for everyone as the intense beef flavor can be overwhelming for some but for me it was perfect. The desert of Chelsea Tart was bomb!

Our waiter, Gabriel, was excellent. Very attentive and friendly."
Fallow,5.0,Booked for dinner with family. What an amazing experience. Akira did a great job with menu suggestions and was very attentive. Had pig's head!! Unforgettable. definitely return.
Fallow,5.0,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday treat. We sat at the 'Chefs Counter' - something I highly recommend you do. You will get to see the chefs working in full swing up close.

The dishes were all spectacular. Our favourites were the Scallop Ceviche and the Tandoori cauliflower. You should not leave without trying the corn ribs.

The wine list catered to a wide range of budgets.

The desserts were fantastic. I can strongly recommend you try the Chelsea tart - it was smooth and creamy.

To round it all off, we had Espresso Martinis, which was by quite far the best one I've ever had.

I will be back. I'm eyeing the cod's head, and the pig's head.

Only loses the point off atmosphere as it was slightly too loud for me."
Fallow,5.0,"We had a fantastic final meal in London at Fallow, made even more special by our amazing waiter Jack.

The food was outstanding‚Äîwe especially loved the corn ribs, ricotta, oysters, and the beef main plate. Every dish was creative and full of flavor.

At the end of our meal, Jack told us he‚Äôd pulled some strings and arranged a surprise: a move from our corner bar seats to the chef‚Äôs counter for a complimentary dessert and final fun experience for the night!

Jack was gracious, attentive, and truly went above and beyond. We‚Äôll be recommending Fallow to everyone we know for sure. Thanks for the perfect send-off!"
Fallow,5.0,"Went here for our anniversary dinner and it did not disappoint. We started with the beef ribs and the potato waffle both of which were amazing but the beef ribs fell off the bone and I would highly recommend.
For mains we had the Fallow burger and the Sandy Black Pork. Both dishes were easily some of the best we have had. At this point we were stuffed but out comes a bowl of soft serve ice creams with some caramel sauce and caramelised cornflakes and a sparkler to wish us a happy anniversary. This tasted so good and it was incredibly thoughtful of the team.
Our waiter Calvin was amazing.  Constantly refreshing our water. Clearing the table and just made our experience even better.
If you are even considering going to Fallow, let this be the reason you decide to go!"
Fallow,5.0,"Fabulous place - we arrived at 3 on a Friday afternoon and the restaurant was very busy and buzzing. David the Maitr'd was very welcoming and Troy our waiter was very knowledgeable and talked us through the dishes (I had no idea what Hen of the Wood was, or Pink Fur Potatoes for that matter.) Everything was delicious but our personal favourites were the ribs and the mushroom parfait. I had the cods head as the big dish, because I had never seen it on a menu before and like to try new dishes. Again it tasted amazing though if you're going all in I would recommend trying the eyeball first as it has a very unusual taste and the dish just gets better and better after that. Thanks also to Toby the sommelier for helping us pick out some lovely wines.
Oh and the fries were the absolute best I've ever tasted! Would love to know the recipe and try them at home."
Fallow,5.0,"I had an incredible dinner last night. I started with the gooseberry heat and the mushroom parfait, followed by the roasted miso aubergine and the rhubarb and custard spritz. I ended the meal with the British cheese board. I loved the inventive, delicious dishes and honestly had never imagined some of the flavors blending so well together. Rose was super attentive and all her recommendations were spot on! Thanks for a lovely evening."
Fallow,5.0,"Had the best Sunday roast at Fallow. The food was exceptional and what made our visit even better was their lovely bartender, Rosa, from Australia. She was so friendly and gracious and took the time to chat with us about living in London as I have just moved over from NZ. She even made an espresso martini shot for us at the end of our dinner because I had mentioned I was tired from a long day. Thank you, Rosa!!"
Fallow,5.0,"Fallow serves up fantastic food, with plenty of exciting dishes on the menu. I‚Äôd recommend skipping the burger ‚Äì I tried it and regretted it only because there were so many other more interesting options, and the burger itself wasn‚Äôt anything special.

The menu is designed for sharing, and I‚Äôd suggest ordering 2‚Äì4 small plates (plus sides get some veg in you) and 2 mains for a satisfying meal. Every other dish we tried was delicious and well worth it.

The dress code is relaxed ‚Äì casual is perfectly fine, and we didn‚Äôt feel out of place.

The staff were excellent, and our server, Amanda, was especially lovely, making the whole experience even better."
Fallow,5.0,"Had a great time here with my friends. The food is great and so do the cocktails. We love the mushroom parfait so much! It is definitely a mush have here. The waiter Josh C. was so helpful as well. Friendly reminder, do you reservation before you come."
Fallow,5.0,"We sat out on the terrace, which was lovely overall ‚Äì although there was a faint, odd odor that came and went, it wasn‚Äôt enough to spoil the experience. My partner had the beef Sunday roast and absolutely loved it. The potatoes were perfectly crispy, and the beef was cooked just right (always a gamble with roasts, but they nailed it here).  I, however, met my new obsession: the spicy tandoori cauliflower. Bold, smoky, and packed with flavor ‚Äì I‚Äôd come back just for that. 10/10 would recommend."
Fallow,5.0,"It was our first time here and we couldn‚Äôt decide if we wanted to have their set lunch or order a bunch of small eats.
Thank god for Alvin, we ordered one set lunch and a bunch of dishes to share and all of his recommendation were 10/10!
The beef ribs WERE INCREDIBLE and the mushroom parfait was so well balanced!"
Fallow,5.0,"Exceptional experience, Ive vyed after eating at Fallow for a long time, and the experience did not fall short whatsoever. Our host Anna was extremely attentive, informative and knowledgeable on drink pairings and answered all of our questions with ease.

Our intolerant guest was catered for to a T and our entire meal was sublime. You will not regret any meal at Fallow, please go if you have been meaning to!

Thank you to all the staff for a fabulous experience, I cannot wait to come back üòª"
Fallow,5.0,"The service was absolutely amazing, our waiter was so helpful with answering our queries and they were able to substitute items we couldn‚Äôt eat. We had the beef short rib, fillet and burger- all were great but the short rib and the sauce on the fillet were the best parts. Fries were also amazing. We came for a birthday and they provided some soft serve for us to share. Bill was around ¬£103 which is quite steep but good place to go for a special occasion"
Fallow,5.0,"I discovered this restaurant through their YouTube channel as I love watching their chef‚Äôs cooking demonstrations. I‚Äôve became mildly obsessed, and the day I arrived in London. I dropped my bag at the hotel and went straight here for lunch.

ÔøºWithout a reservation I only had a short wait, but I would advise booking in advance as it is no secret, how wonderful this place is.

I sat at the bar but I would recommend sitting at the chef counter, so you can watch all the activity in the kitchen. They also have outdoor seating which is covered and on the side street so still sunny and off the main drag.

The greatest challenge with dining solo is that you have to manage how much you order. Trying to be conservative I started with the Duck pancake, and I swear I could‚Äôve eaten six of these. They are so delicious light and fantastic. Ôøº

For my main, I ordered the Sandy black pork, which was juicy and sweet. I pretty much clean the plate and in an effort to get a little vegetable in my belly I ordered the Isle of White tomato salad.

Because I meal like this requires wine, I started with an Alvari√±o, and then shifted to a red selection from Greece, that was made by the bartender. I‚Äôm glad I tried the Greek wine, but I still stand firm in my opinion about Greek wines. Ôøº

If you were reading this review, and considering going I highly recommend it. I would suggest coming with friends, but she will still have a wonderful time, if dining alone."
Fallow,5.0,"Excellent food, and service. We had the tasting menu, and all of the dishes were extraordinary.
The service was very attentive. My food intolerances were met with alternatives, when communicated properly. One misunderstood regarding my food intolerance led to a free meal for my husband - which is, again, a sign of great service. The restaurant lives up to the hype. :)"
Fallow,5.0,"Worthy of its spot on the Michelin Guide and the best meal we had in London! JC was wonderful and gave us great recommendations. Here are some of my thoughts on the dishes we tried.

Mushroom parfait: I could have eaten so much more of this. Smooth, with an umami flavour and a subtle sweetness. Probably our favourite dish.

Burrata with chilli oil: An unusual combination, but we were pleasantly surprised by how good it was! The mild, creamy flavour and texture of the burrata really complemented the distinct flavour and crunchiness of the crispy chili oil.

Bavette steak: Tender pieces of steak served with buttery tallow and an extremely rich, flavourful sauce.

Sweet corn with brown butter soft serve: The only thing I wasn‚Äôt completely crazy about, but that's really just a personal preference. Brown butter is a very mild flavour for ice cream and it just wasn't my cup of tea.

Chelsea tart: Every bite is of the most decadent caramel tart. It has a very slight bitterness that helps to balance the sweetness perfectly. We loved this one."
Fallow,5.0,"came here for a solo birthday dinner and the staff‚Äôs hospitality is top notch! had the oyster martini, mushroom parfait and cod head, ending off with the soft serve dessert. am full of good food by the end of the meal. such a great time. would like to come back and try the mussels next!"
Fallow,5.0,"We had an early pre-theatre dinner here at Fallow on Haymarket, and it was wonderful.  We ordered from the set menu with a couple of extra dishes on the side.

As extras to the set menu we ordered the beef short ribs and corn ribs as a little appetiser. The ribs were beautiful, the meat was flavoursome and so tender it just fell off the bone.  The corn ribs were something I'd not had before, I don't what the seasoning on them was but they were really tasty (I could have happily had just a glass of wine and a big dish of these!)

For our starters we ordered the burrata with caramelised onions and chilli and the mushroom parfait.  We ordered a portion of bread and butter to go with the starters but in hindsight this was a bit ambitious as the portion sizes were generous and I felt we didn't do the delicious crusty, warm bread justice.  The burrata was excellent quality, and worked really well with the onions and chilli.  The mushroom parfait was light and savoury, and served with generous amount of grilled bread.

For our mains we had the rolled lamb shoulder and the flamed mussels.  The lamb was tender and nicely cooked, served with crushed peas.  The mussels were cooked in a sriracha sauce, again, a generous portion.  I've not had mussels cooked in this kind of sauce before and they were absolutely delicious, there was a bread cro√ªte at the bottom of the dish which was an excellent way to soak up the last of the wonderful sauce (I may have used a spoon too...)

My friend chose the polenta cake with peach comp√¥te for her dessert and I opted for the sweetcorn and brown butter ice cream with smoked caramel.  I was curious as to how sweetcorn would work in a dessert and didn't quite know what to expect.  It was prepared almost like cornflakes and coated in a sweet crunchy caramel.  The ice cream was lovely too, I couldn't really taste anything smoky about the caramel but that might just be me.  The polenta cake was soaked in a syrup and the comp√¥te fresh and light.  We shared our desserts and polenta cake worked especially well with the ice cream.

The set menu is served until 5pm and is ¬£42 for 3 courses."
Fallow,4.0,"My feelings are mixed but leaning positive >

The service is phenomenal and it doesn‚Äôt seem forced. The staff seem to genuinely care and act like people, not machines programmed to serve which is a good representation of how the company treats them. Makes you feel happy.

The food is overall good and solely depends on personal preference. I came specifically for the corn ribs I‚Äôve heard much about. MUST GET!! I practically vacuumed them off the plate!! The portobello mushroom burger was nostalgic and exquisite ! Reminded me of my teenage years in Notting Hill. And all the desserts lived up to expectation.

The only negative I have was regarding the burrata- the seasoning tasted foul to both our taste buds, but hey I‚Äôm not an avid food connoisseur so what do we know. To your average person it tasted a little too salty and way too overstimulating.

They provided me a charger and it saved my life ! They take very good care of you"
Fallow,4.0,"We had a fabulous date night at Fallow. Four stars as I felt the price didn't quite match the food. Everything was packed full of flavour, perhaps even too much in some cases where I felt the flavour overpowered the produce (e.g. mussels).

We ordered the corn ribs, beef ribs, mushroom parfait, mussels, burger, ice cream and Chelsea tart. No regrets on what we ordered, but standouts were the mushroom parfait and the two desserts."
Fallow,4.0,"The food was delicious, but I didn't really like how the tables are laid out, as it felt like we were sat in a busy corridor with people brushing past constantly. Navigating a path to the bathrooms was also tricky. The service was very good but it would have been nice if the staff could have proactively made some suggestions on drinks pairings. I enjoyed it but I don't think I'd go back."
Fallow,5.0,Excellent visit asked for the discretionary charged to be removed. I prefer to tip in cash in London only higher denomination note I had was üí∂ so used that.  A visit I will repeat once again.  Perhaps one of the other sister restaurants.
Fallow,4.0,"This place truly shines when it comes to its small plates ‚Äî the Mushroom Parfait was so incredible we ended up ordering four of them, and the Corn Ribs were so addictive we had to get a second round. While the main dishes didn‚Äôt quite impress us the same way, the overall experience was still enjoyable. The ambiance is gorgeous and thoughtfully designed, making it a perfect spot for a laid-back yet stylish gathering. The staff were attentive, kind, and made us feel very welcome. A beautiful space with standout bites worth coming back for."
Fallow,5.0,Roast was delicious - best potato‚Äôs and gravy I‚Äôve had with a roast. Our server Ana was so kind and made the experience even better. I would really recommend here for the roast! Only negative I found was that my rump was slightly undercooked
Fallow,5.0,"One of the best restaurants in London and highly worth a trip. Everything about Fallow is great from their ethos around sustainable, local and seasoning cooking to the sites he hot sauce which you can buy (delicious). The food its self is delicious. Highly recommend the mushroom parfait, any of the burgers and beef ribs. Also don‚Äôt forget to save space for the deserts! The service is very attentive and the waiters are happy to answer any questions you have about the menu. If you are in London are looking for a restaurant with amazing food, atmosphere and decor then Fallow is the place to be."
Fallow,5.0,"Our time at Fallow was a good one, mainly because we were served by Alvin who was attentive and approachable providing good service. He also gave us a free dessert to celebrate our anniversary, which was very thoughtful of him and the restaurant.

We ordered corn ribs, duck pancake, mushroom parfait and cod head.

Standout dish was the mushroom parfait. Earthy and slightly sweet, great starter. The cod head was fun to dissect (revealed a lot more meat than expected), but you must have the patience to do so.

The prices are on the higher side, but that is expected with the level of skill and service provided. The vibe of the entire restaurant was also very inviting and lively, which makes it a great hangout spot."
Fallow,5.0,"Hip and vibrant, this restaurant delivers a modern take on British cuisine in a lively, buzzing atmosphere. It was absolutely packed on a Thursday night, so reservations are a must.

The concept is sharing plates, and every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and beautifully plated. The corn rib was the perfect start- crisp, salty, and seasoned with kombu to awaken the taste buds. The smoked beef ribs were another standout: fall-apart tender and glazed with a rich, flavorful sauce. Vegetarian options shone as well - the roasted miso aubergine and harissa cauliflower were incredible, layered with umami and topped with crunchy textures.

On our server‚Äôs recommendation, we finished with the Chelsea tart, and it did not disappoint. The custard was luxuriously smooth and slightly salty, perfectly balanced by the mild milk ice cream - a flawless end to the meal.

Service was warm, attentive, and highly accommodating. Overall, a must-visit for exceptional food, interesting plating, and an electric atmosphere."
Fallow,5.0,"It's a lovely cheat, as a warm welcome primes you to look for more things to appreciate. Impeccable service.
The parfait and beef ribs were out of this world.
The corn ribs were lovely, in particular with the lime juice.
The cod head was tasty, admittedly not living up to the rest but still absolutely no regrets.
A memorable experience living up to the YouTube hype."
Fallow,5.0,"If you‚Äôre in London and want a dining experience that blends creativity, bold flavors, and genuine hospitality ‚Äì FALLOW is an absolute must!

The Mushroom Parfait is silky and rich, the Smoked Beef Ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender with deep smoky notes, and the Burger is pure perfection ‚Äì juicy, flavorful, and served in a perfectly toasted bun. For something truly unique, try the Beef Tartare & Oysters ‚Äì a daring yet perfect combination of fresh brininess and rich beef.

But the star that sets FALLOW apart is their Smoked Cod‚Äôs Head ‚Äì beautifully presented, delicately smoked, and packed with flavor that will completely change the way you think about fish. It‚Äôs an absolute showstopper.

On top of all this, the staff make the experience unforgettable ‚Äì warm, attentive, and genuinely passionate about what they do. You‚Äôre not just having a meal here, you‚Äôre creating a memory.

Book ahead ‚Äì this is one of those places you‚Äôll want to revisit again."
Fallow,5.0,"One of the top 10 meals I‚Äôve ever eaten. Everything was immaculate from the service on down to the presentation. I let the chef choose my dinner which started out with the street corn, then mushroom p√¢t√©, which was possibly one of the best things I‚Äôve ever eaten. Next, I had the beef rib and the fried potato waffle. Finishing up the dinner with an incredible burger and fries. The sweet corn soft serve was a perfect dessert which was not too sweet, but had an incredible combination of textures. I know they‚Äôre listed in the Michelin guide, but in my opinion, they deserve a star."
Fallow,5.0,"Great experience, all staff interactions were friendly, professional, and full of personality. Erick, my server, went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect. The food was excellent, and eating facing the kitchen pure theatre. Would recommend for any occasion with plenty of choice to suit."
Fallow,5.0,"We had a great time during our visit. Both the food and service were perfect from start to finish. I had really high expectations from following the restaurant on YouTube, recommendations from people like Ben at Sorted Food and your socials. All these expectations were exceeded.

Highly recommend the corn ribs, Sunday roast and the Chelsea tart.

Thanks a lot for a great meal"
Fallow,5.0,"The staff were super friendly and helpful with food recommendations, which made the experience feel welcoming right from the start. Service was impressively fast ‚Äî the dishes came out quickly without feeling rushed.

The mussels were a real highlight: fresh, tender, and swimming in a rich, buttery sauce that was perfect for dipping. Honestly, I‚Äôd go back just for that.
The corn ribs made for a fun, crunchy starter, and the beetroot salad was a surprisingly strong contender too ‚Äî the crispy seaweed on top added this brilliant textural contrast that made the dish pop.

The burger was a heavy-hitter: juicy, flavorful, and the blue cheese brought just the right amount of punch without overpowering the beef. Properly done.

The only miss? The drinks. Way too sweet ‚Äî like someone dropped a packet of candy into a cocktail shaker. Not a dealbreaker, but next time I‚Äôd probably skip them and stick to the food."
Fallow,5.0,"We had a great experience for dinner. The staff was very friendly! We got the ribeye and it was delicious, as well as the corn ribs. Some portion sizes were a bit small, but all of the food tasted great. They had warmers and blankets for outdoor seating as well.
Only downside is for the steaks, you do have to get a very large portion to share, they don't really have individual portions depending on the day."
Fallow,5.0,"Lunch at Fallow on Haymarket.

Really not sure why we haven‚Äôt been here before, however this place is awesome.

Fantastic food, some original dishes, all full of flavour. Couldn‚Äôt pick a favourite, all were consistently excellent.

Busy, buzzy, complimented with top, friendly service, with Joyce looking after us well. Sitting at the counter is the way to go.

Love their sustainability ethos too. With a set lunch menu of ¬£42 a head, this ticks all the boxes. Definitely worth a look.

Loved it. We will be back again soon, that‚Äôs for sure."
Scully,4.0,"Scully in St. James‚Äôs delivers one of the most exciting dining experiences in London. Every dish bursts with bold, unexpected flavours‚Äîthink rich spices, clever pickling, and perfect balance. The open kitchen and shelves of colourful ferments set the tone, while the service is warm and knowledgeable.

From bold welcome snacks like spiced chickpeas and tendon crackers with oyster cream to vegetable-driven stars like forbidden rice or a delicate tomato-strawberry-coconut salad, every dish feels thoughtful yet off-beat

A true gem for adventurous food lovers."
Scully,5.0,Had a truly fabulous meal here last night. It is truly impressive how such unusual ingredients are blended to create such exceptional flavours. I also love the relaxed atmosphere. Our favourite main was the hogget. Just wow.  My friend‚Äôs 13 year old son hoovered EVERYTHING up. I think that says it all! Well done team!!
Scully,4.0,"Scully, Chef Ramael Scully, born in Malaysia to a mother of Chinese and Indian heritage and an Irish-Balinese father. He grew up in Sydney. Chef Scully brings an array of international influences to his self-titled restaurant; from Malaysia to Sydney via India and China.
The dishes bursted with flavours but with the right balance. I also noticed extensive use of exotic vegetables within the dish itself.
The ambience is casual and relaxed. Service was friendly, attentive and professional."
Scully,5.0,Absolutely wonderful experience. Met with a friend for lunch and was looked after brilliantly by the front of house team. Wine - amazing. Food - amazing. Ambience - amazing! I definitely need to spend more time here ü§ô
Scully,5.0,"Really depends on what you order. The dishes I ordered are extremely delicious, but the ones my partner ordered are genuinely mediocre. The chicken leg is great! Pity that no tasting menu option for lunch."
Scully,5.0,"Exceptional on all fronts. For a reasonably early reservation we got an amazing spot, with a view of the whole restaurant. From start to finish, the whole experience was outstanding.

The food itself was head and shoulders above what you would experience at other tasting menus. The unique vegan menu, blew away the standard options you might get elsewhere. And the quality of every dish was indescribable. Overall, each dish was well balanced with ingredients and flavours. But the menu also had an excellent flow.

The wine complemented each dish and elevated all the flavours. A special thanks to Luis, who talked us through each pairing and shares our enthusiasm. 10/10"
Scully,5.0,"Not usually a fan of fusion cuisine, but each dish surpassed expectations - super simple lunch, great service and friendly head chef. Would love to try the tasting menu."
Scully,4.0,"I love the atmosphere and friendly service of this restaurant, dishes were served quickly but you have a lot of time to enjoy them.
The portions are very generous and they are of great taste if you enjoy flavours, though you might found some dishes a little bit heavy on the use of oil.
Generally it is a restaurant I would revisit with friends, especially given the relaxed environment, you can see their kitchen and service being really friendly."
Scully,5.0,"Great Tasting menu with interesting and wonderful food combinations. The wine pairing was well thought through and explored some wines you wouldn‚Äôt usually go for.

Service was the perfect balance of being friendly and informative while also being subtle and attentive"
Scully,5.0,"Scully St James‚Äôs truly has it all. Incredible food, atmosphere and service. Chef was incredibly kind to accommodate our late arrival and cook some amazingly flavorful dishes - highly recommend the tasting menu, but come hungry. We started with mushrooms, fried octopus and tomato salad. The sauces here deserve their own awards. Our starters and mains are shown in the pictures, and each was its own work of art in addition to be delicious.
The other standout? Luis and his fellow waitstaff. They didn‚Äôt make us feel rushed, offered suggestions and had great senses of humor.
What else could you ask for? Oh, excellent cocktail and wine list - check. We enjoyed their take on an old fashioned and elderflower gin fizz, followed by Georgian, Spanish and French wines/champagne.
Plan to spend two hours, enjoy the open kitchen and laid back feel. Cannot recommend more."
Scully,5.0,"What a wonderful experience. From start to finish everything was perfect. The hostess greeted us without even asking our names, then sat us in a nice area in the restaurant where we could see everything. The kitchen has an open concept, so it‚Äôs nice to see what they were doing without sitting at the counter. We were served our food at a nice pace and in enough time to catch our play at the theatre. Favourite dishes were the pork belly and spiced cake dessert. The aubergine was served cold, which would have been more complimentary warm or hot. The crispy rice cracker had a beautiful texture too."
Scully,4.0,"Overall the food was good. We had the lunch 3 course tasting menu. The starters we ordered were a miss for me personally. The pork belly with the anchovy sauce was a little too salty for my liking and th monkfish cheeks were just alright. The fish w pistachio sambal main eas a star though! The pastrami was decent as well. For dessert, we had the basil popping dish which was fantastic. Would definitely recommend. We did not really like the pineapple blueberry dessert. It was not very balanced, the blueberry compote was too overpowering. Would have done better with a vanilla or tonka bean cream or ice cream. The service was excellent though and we were offered the arepa and eggplant sambal on the house which was very good. Would recommend ordering that!"
Scully,5.0,"I had a fantastic time at Sculpt Restaurant. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was warm, stylish, and welcoming ‚Äì the perfect setting for a relaxed meal.

The food was absolutely spot on ‚Äì full of flavour, beautifully presented, and clearly made with care. Every dish felt thoughtfully crafted, and the quality really stood out.

The vibe of the place was just right too ‚Äì a great balance of lively yet laid-back, with music and lighting that added to the overall experience without being overbearing.

Highly recommend Sculpt for anyone looking for delicious food in a great setting. I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
Scully,5.0,". Great quality and portions. Everything was amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to go back again.
The kitchen staff looked happy and even when they were super busy the vibe was very good. I can‚Äôt say what I liked the most because everything I had was delicious.  were the best I ever had. Amazing food, service, and exceptional good cocktails"
Scully,3.0,"I had been wanting to go here for a long time, but saw a review a while ago that made me question the integrity of some of the reviews. But I finally bit the bullet and went tonight. Firstly, the service was great. But the food was disappointing for the price point.

Disclaimer - I‚Äôm vegetarian, but there are plenty of veggie dishes on the menu so I had high hopes. The aubergine starter was nice enough but nothing particularly special. And the forbidden rice felt like a bowl of rice with a few things sprinkled around the edges but it lacked a main element and a wow factor. I should also say that my wife really enjoyed the pork belly starter and her chicken main was nice, but again not exceptional. For almost ¬£200 for 2 with one drink each (only one alcoholic) we left feeling a lack of value for money. Hopefully the other reviews are genuine and we just ordered badly."
Scully,5.0,"I cannot rave about this place enough. The food was amazing, which I‚Äôd heard anyway, but then the service and attentiveness was a whole other level. I was blown away by the kindness and care that went into customising so many dishes and even creating something off menu so I could enjoy a meal out with gestational diabetes AND it was done with such hospitality and grace, like it wasn‚Äôt even a problem let alone an inconvenience. I still can‚Äôt get over how incredible every single member of staff we spoke to and dealt with was, and how humble Scully was when we thanked him at the end. Such an amazing experience, I can‚Äôt wait to be back, and am so glad we discovered it to begin with. A real memorable experience, for both the quality and flavour of the food, but then also the hospitality and service, each within their own right. Thank you for such a lovely memorable evening; it was our first date night without kids in 3 years, but it was special and memorable more because of all the staff and their incredible attitude!"
Scully,5.0,I wanted to try a new restaurant so I done some exploring and found this place. The service was amazing really friendly and polite. The food came in good time and was very pleased with the service and the food quality. I would definitely recommend trying out this spot. I could not complain. Will be returning another time for more delicious food.
Scully,5.0,"This was my second visit but I hadn‚Äôt visited since 2018 when I had an excellent time. I‚Äôm happy to say it lived up to expectations again. The food was delicious and full of flavour. We opted for the 2 courses for ¬£60 but between the three of us, we got a different starter and main to share. As starters, we shared the arepa with eggplant sambal and labneh (loved the flavour and texture), monkfish cheeks (tasted like a deconstructed laksa) and crispy pork belly (good). For the mains, we shared the forbidden black rice (unique dish to Scully and had really interesting but tasty flavour), seabass (well cooked) and the beef cheek pastrami (this was melt in your mouth and so good) as mains. The portion sizes were generous which is uncommon at establishments like this so it was refreshing to see. The service was thorough, helpful and attentive."
Scully,5.0,"Absolutely phenomenal experience! From the impeccable service to the exquisite dishes, every detail was perfect. The flavors were rich, creative, and beautifully presented. Easily one of the best dining experiences I've ever had ‚Äî truly deserving of 5 stars!"
Scully,5.0,"Such a special restaurant with incredible food, great service from a welcoming team and a genuinely cool vibe. The flavours were enormous and soundtrack kept you chilled. I will be returning soon to check out the new season menu."
Scully,5.0,"Quickly became my favourite restaurant in London (and I am a foodie). I‚Äôve been to 1 and 2 Michelin stars, but to me nothing compares to the experience Scully provides. The richness of flavours, the details, the innovative approach, the portions, the fact you basically have a chef‚Äôs table experience and get to watch him working up closely throughout the whole dinner, it‚Äôs unmatchable. Never had a better wine flight either - the wine pairing with the arepa it‚Äôs unbelievably good. My brother in law is vegan and he said he was the best tasting menu he had too. And the chef is so approachable and nice! I could spend hours writing about the incredible alchemy is done in here, but I will just say: BOOK YOUR TABLE."
Scully,5.0,"The food here is EXCELLENT and I'll definitely be back.

The restaurant is smart but has a nice relaxed atmosphere with friendly & attentive staff. We went with the a la carte menu which we felt was good value given the quality of the food and including a glass of prosecco was a nice touch.

Every dish was outstanding - the enoki mushroom and watermelon 'snacks' were a highlight, and every dish that followed was delicious, with inspriation from so many parts of the world. Honestly can't wait to return and try all the dishes we didn't get to order. Well done Scully & team :)"
Scully,5.0,"I dined at Scully‚Äôs for my birthday and every minute of the experience was 11/10.

We sat by the bar and our two waiters Luis & Zaf were great fun and very attentive. Also, chef Scully was very social and kindly let us taste additional dishes as he was so passionate about the vegan tasting menu and introducing us to different dishes beyond the menu offering. We felt very spoilt and each dish was exceptional. As two foodies it is hard to blow us away, but genuinely this has to be the best meal I have ever eaten. My sister agrees! Thank you so much to the team for taking such good care of us and filling our bellies with sensational food. I have already booked to go back again and I only left an hour ago!

Cannot recommend enough."
Scully,5.0,"Nestled in the heart of the city, Scully is a culinary gem that offers a dining experience like no other. From the moment we stepped through the door, we were greeted by extremely welcoming staff.

Our evening at Scully began with a delightful array of appetizers that set the tone for what was to come. The Masala Chickpeas with Butternut Squash and Tahini were a burst of exotic flavors that danced on the palate, while the Salt & Pepper Shimeji Mushrooms with Yeast Vinaigrette provided a savory umami kick that left us craving more.

The Arepa topped with Eggplant Sambal and Bergamot Labneh was a true revelation, blending textures and tastes in a way that was both comforting and exciting. The BBQ Asparagus with Burned Butter Tzatziki and Datterino Cherry Tomatoes was a dish that celebrated the freshness of the ingredients, each bite bursting with summer flavors.

The Scallops with Friarielli and Green Peas were a highlight of the meal, perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. We also ordered the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.

To end our meal on a refreshing note, we savored a dish of melon, pimelo seeds, and alfonso mango that was a symphony of sweetness and tanginess, the perfect way to cleanse the palate and leave us feeling satisfied.

Overall, our experience at Scully was nothing short of exceptional. The creativity and skill of the chefs shone through in every dish, and the attentive service only added to the overall enjoyment of the evening. If you're looking for a dining experience that will both surprise and delight your taste buds, look no further than Scully."
Scully,5.0,"Our friends recommended this place and I book it on the evening of the day we arrived at London. Warm and friendly staffs, some took times to chat with us. I opted for the 2-course prix-fixed and my wife ordered an entree a-la-carte. The Crispy Pork Belly, Fish Caramel, Sweet-Heart Cabbage & Pomelo Slaw was mouth watering and brought me back to familiar childhood flavors (south Vietnam), the BBQ Onglet, Padron Peppers, Spring Onions, Jerusalem Artichokes, Taleggio was just as fantastic and the portion was perfect. My wife loved her Sea Bass, Baby Leeks, Pickled Mustard Greens, Tauco. We shared the Popping Candy Basil Pot, and the flavor exploded in each bite. Since we were the the only guests at the restaurant, we had photos taken with Chef Scully. What an honor to dine at this fabulous restaurant. Strongly recommended."
Scully,5.0,"Dear team and respected administration of the restaurant Scully!

I am pleased and looking forward to thanking you for a pleasant soulful evening in a warm atmosphere, amazing host servise & exquisite food.

Gratitude for the amazing history of the creation of the restaurant and the history of food through which the most pleasant administrator immersed us.

Many thanks to the chef Scully for his exquisite dishes and golden hands!

The best restaurant I have visited recently, the best fish I have eaten in London!

I can safely say that I will come more and more often, recommend it to all my friends and be sure to inspire my subscribers with my stories and snaps from this restaurant.

Sincerely, Svyatoslav ! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Scully,5.0,"""We found the eating experience unique in offering shared portions and innovative food combinations. The staff were incredibly well informed and able to give in-depth detail which made our tasting explorative and stimulating. We will definitely
be back soon, thank you."""
Scully,4.0,"Food 8/10
Mochi Dumpling: LOVE. Absolutely a must get. It was not shaped the way that I was expecting, but it was super flavorful and textured, in a pleasantly surprising way. The combination of ingredients really blew me away.
Arepas: Yummy but quite small, and I even liked the eggplant dip, even though I usually dislike thta vegetable.
Crisped Pork Belly: Could be passed on, it was a little cold and too fatty without enough crisp.
Cod: Too creamy sauce for me, but it was very tender.
Dark Chocolate Sorbet: Very yummy, surprisingly rich for what it is made of.
Not the happiest about the 9 pound shot they added to my kombucha drink.

Atmosphere 10/10
Love the modern interior, very clean and perfectly temperate. Spacious between tables and lighting was super cool.

Service 7/10
Slightly lacking in attentiveness and were acting a bit defensive when I asked if there was any alcohol in my kombucha, but besides that, good service."
Scully,5.0,"Every bite was phenomenal and service was perfection. The dishes were dynamic, textural, tasty, and beautiful. Would 10000% recommend and can't wait to return on my next visit to London!"
Scully,4.0,The dishes and the flavours are really special and something you won‚Äôt get everyday. Loved the way food was displayed. The fish we had was simply ‚Äúwow‚Äù. We had a very nice evening at this place. However have to deduct one star as initially we were seated at a table next to the kitchen although other tables were available and we had reserved up front. We were also reminded before ordering dessert that we would have to leave within the next 15 min due to the next reservation coming up.
Scully,5.0,"Absolutely delicious and really interesting dishes, with sometimes unusual (but absolutely worth trying) flavour combinations. In particular, we loved the oyster mushrooms with yeast flake sauce - it tasted incredible and had so much flavour for something so simple. The staff were excellent, attentive and informative."
Scully,4.0,"Interesting and exploratory tasting menu. Vegetables were great; fish could be more tender. Reasonable prices overall.
Won‚Äôt be coming back, but worth trying!"
Scully,5.0,"This blew our expectations away. Great vibe (buzzy but relaxed), excellent friendly personable service, creative delicious dishes. Each had a fun riff on traditional flavor combinations. Vegetable dishes were a standout. Also an excellent wine list but prepare to splash out for the good stuff. Our waitress said we needed about 6 dishes to share among 3 people but 4-5 would have been fine. Cool open kitchen."
Scully,5.0,"Truly excellent driven by the passion of Scully himself. I been 4 times on a Saturday night over the past year or so and each time perfection has been delivered.

The staff are knowledgeable and will explain is needed, the way to eat each dish. The food is always well presented and prepared under the watchful eyes of the Owner/ Chef himself.

Booking essential. Give it a go !"
Scully,5.0,"My partner had been wanting to go here for ages and chose his birthday as the perfect time and it absolutely was.

Everything was perfect. The food was honestly insane, we shared the pork starter and the egg plant Sambal as our starters. And both had the BBQ Onglet as the mains.

I can‚Äôt fault anything - at all. It was divine!!!

The service was amazing too and we mentioned we were full and had cake at home for my partners birthday but my partner was still brought a little sweet treat and was excellent!!!! Superb food and service

10/10 from us.

On the way out I had to tell Chef Scully it was AMAZING! We hope to return soon!"
Scully,5.0,"Really impressed with the starters. I could‚Äôve just had those and been happy! The mains were good too, but less impressive (at least the fish was- it was good. The kombucha was delicious. Service was great, very friendly & attentive staff"
Scully,5.0,"What a wonderful experience. I have to say the two snacks we had before our starter were so outstanding I would class those as better than most restaurants I've been to. The asparagus, tahini with the mushroom vinaigrette - jeez, Louise, we knew we were in for a ride. The dessert, the olive oil cake was possibly in my top 3 desserts of all time. Everything in between was spot on - if anything, just the turnip cake starter was the only miss, but that's probably just my taste buds not prepared for the unami and savoury explosion in my mouth. Top notch, wonderful experience, wonderful people, will come back in the future for sure. So different."
Scully,5.0,"Fantastic, innovative food. Loved the black fig starter which is to die for - such interesting flavours which work so well together.   Wonderful wine, great service and relaxed professional ambience.  This restaurant sets a high bar and deserves to do well."
Scully,5.0,"The food is always outstanding‚Äîeach dish bursts with unique flavours and textures that are both creative and memorable. You can really tell the thought and care that goes into every plate. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the service consistently makes me feel at ease and well looked after. Truly a standout dining experience every time."
Scully,5.0,"We were a large group and managed to order just about the whole menu. The celiac accommodation (gluten-free) was fine, although there were several dishes I wanted to eat but could not. Overall the food was excellent, and I was excited to eat here after cooking from the Nopi cookbook for many years. The service was variable, often slow, and at times abrupt."
Scully,4.0,"Really impressed with the starters (we had the roasted pumpkin & the arepa)- I could‚Äôve just had those and been happy! The mains were good too, but less impressive (at least the fish was- it was good, but could‚Äôve used a bit more
Flavour). The kombucha was delicious but felt unreasonably priced at ¬£12. Service was great, very friendly & attentive staff."
Scully,2.0,"This was meant to be a very special night for our anniversary, but sadly the evening turned into an unpleasant experience. I tried to call the Restaurant Manager, Fernando, sent an email to report the below constructive feedback six weeks ago and chased once, but have never heard back - very disappointing for such a hyped, highly rated restaurant. Here is my critique:
1. Coffee machine: we were given the choice to either sit in the far left back towards the till and staff exit/entrance, on the right side along the aisle or on the left side at the window front. I chose the window front, in the hope that we will benefit from some natural daylight and views. About 30mins into our 5-course vegan tasting dinner, early diners started ordering coffee, and the machine, which sat right above my head behind me made such a loud noise that I could not hear my partner's voice anymore. This happened a number of times in short succession, which was very unpleasant, given this evening was about quality time and positive vibes, which didn't quite hold up against the coffee machine's noise.
2. Bread crumbs/setting the table: After the second course, there were breadcrumbs on the table. The dishes were cleared ahead of bringing the third course, but then the fresh plates and food were placed on the dirty table, which should have been wiped/cleaned between courses as there was sufficient time in between and this level of service can be expected at a restaurant of self-claimed high standards such as the Scully. Between dishes two and three, we had our cutlery cleaned away, but were not given a fresh set of it, so by the time the hot main course arrived, we did not have cutlery ready to start eating. This meant the dish was getting cold while trying to get a waiter's attention.
3. Ingredients: the third course (at this point we have been handled by three different team members already) we were served by a waitress who explained to us the ingredients/components of the dish in front of us. Unfortunately, she forgot the fifth and last ingredient, apologised and smiled and walked away. I totally understand that we are all humans and make mistakes or forget things, but at a pricey restaurant with sky-high reputation like the Scully, I would have expected staff to manage remembering 5 ingredients. That waiter also didn't care to find out what the final ingredient was and come back to us with the answer...
4. Smoking staff: I was sat facing the end of the room, looking toward the back exit/entrance next to the till. Staff was going in and out frequently. Whilst this would not have bothered me at all, the fact that they lit cigarettes in vicinity to us, well visible through the window front, was not very nice. I also did not get the impression that they would've washed their hands after coming back in, which left me with an unpleasant thought. Nothing against staff being allowed to keep their habits, but ideally not visible to guests.
5. Anniversary: despite placing the note in my reservation that this dinner was our anniversary, none of the staff (neither the hostess, nor any of the 4 waiters we had that night) mentioned a word about it and obviously also did not surprise us with a small gesture. This was very disappointing and whilst we wouldn't have expected to get anything, at least the mention and acknowledgment of it would have made us feel more welcome and valued.
Sadly, I won't return to this restaurant under current management as I did not feel valued and there was a clear lack of value for the money."
Scully,5.0,"Lovely experience! We were pleased by the high quality service, ambience and food.

We were seated at the ‚Äòcounter‚Äô which gives you a look in the kitchen and enables you to talk with the chefs. For a foodie like me that‚Äôs a dream come true.

We (2 persons) shared sever dishes, all prepared with so much love and dedication. My personal favorite was the mutton on bisbas.

We took 3 deserts cause they were all so amazing. Thanks again, props for the cooks and host."
Scully,5.0,"An unforgettable culinary journey at Scully ‚Äì truly a hidden gem in London.
From the moment we arrived at Scully, we knew we were in for a special experience. Tucked away in St James‚Äôs Market, this restaurant strikes a perfect balance between intimate and lively, refined and relaxed. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, with a beautifully designed open kitchen that lets you see the magic happen. You can instantly sense that this is a place driven by passion, creativity, and a genuine love for food.

The service was flawless from start to finish. Every member of the staff was professional, friendly, and deeply knowledgeable about the menu. Our server guided us through the dishes with thoughtful recommendations, and even shared interesting insights about the ingredients and inspirations behind some of the items. It felt like a truly personalised experience ‚Äî not just dining, but discovering."
Scully,5.0,"What a place. Meal of the year so far!

We sat at the counter which was great, as we had a good few chats with the chef's and could see all the dishes going out.

The food was crazy tasty. Highly recommend the corn bread which I think is their signature dish. We could have eaten only that and we'd have been happy."
Scully,5.0,"My favourite restaurant in London (favourite restaurant full stop!)
Scully pairs classic and unique flavours that will have you come back again and again, keen to try what you didn't order on the menu last time.
The tasting menu is a must with the vegan and vegetarian options on offer well worth ordering as well if you're dining as two.
The selection and pairing of wines on offer is fantastic and the service from the team is welcoming and professional."
Scully,5.0,"A beautiful vision executed perfectly on a plate. Every bite was a marvel and a mystery unwrapped by your own imagination. Personally, I tasted flavour combinations that sparked my inner child. I was grinning from ear to ear.

With all my joy and happiness, I found myself asking this burring question! Why are they feeding me like I am in an orphanage? I know it's fine dining but come on bruh they didn't have to do me like Oliver Twist.

Food so good I would have licked the plate. I shall return but next time just add an extra beef cheek or two."
Scully,5.0,"They ""Scully Restaurant is an absolute must-visit in London! The food is incredibly inventive with mind-blowing flavours, and the service is simply impeccable. The atmosphere is vibrant yet comfortable, making for a truly memorable dining experience. Highly, highly recommend!"""
Scully,5.0,"The best restaurant in London you‚Äôve never heard of.

PROS
-vibrant menu, not sticking to one cuisine, a nice fusion of various tastes
-presentation of dishes is beautiful, thinking of the curry courgette which looked like a caterpillar
-small, cosy and romantic restaurant; available for booking
-good location just off Piccadilly
-honestly some of the tastiest food iv had in London in 15 years
-chef Scully himself visible to customers as he is cooking in the open plan kitchen
-menu changes seasonally
-we got a free dessert as it was my friend‚Äôs birthday which was an olive sponge cake, very interesting combo

CONS
-expensive but given you are getting Michelin-star type food, it‚Äôs fair
-not many vegan options
-fairly small portions so you‚Äôll need at least 2 courses to feel full"
Scully,5.0,"Everything so well presentable and tasty. My favourite restaurant so far. Great quality and portions. Everything was amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to go back again.
The kitchen staff looked happy and even when they were super busy the vibe was very good. I can‚Äôt say what I liked the most because everything I had was delicious. The aubergines, the oyster mushrooms, the fried flatbread and cuttlefish were the best I ever had. Amazing food, service, and exceptional good cocktails"
Scully,3.0,"Nice vision, just not our flavor combos and was under seasoned for our taste. Innovation is a risky venture. Waiter was a little on top of us describing everything when the food should really be doing the talking. Some decent wines by the glass and so-so cocktails.  The arepas snack/starter stole the show and must be a popular item because it‚Äôs on their advertising. Unless you‚Äôve already tried everything on the block, you might do better elsewhere."
Scully,5.0,Phenomenal dining experience from start to finish! The staff was so knowledgeable and we could feel their joy of their work shine through. I highly recommend dining here.
Scully,5.0,"Please give Scully‚Äôs a star.
While you‚Äôre dining here, are you experiencing art? Science? Culture? Family? Travel? You‚Äôll have to determine this for yourself. All I can say is that I experienced all of the above and that  Scully and his team do not disappoint. An evening at Scully‚Äôs is more than words can do justice.

It is expensive, yes, but saving up to experience the magic that is Scully‚Äôs feels like a no-brainer for anyone who appreciates quality food and a fine dining experience (without the cold snootiness of other London restaurants). The commitment to sustainability and no waste is a huge bonus, and makes the investment taste that much better.

More plainly, the food is beyond excellent, innovative, and simply bliss. The staff bring grounding to the out-of-this-world culinary experience.

It has been nearly a year since enjoying a long evening here, yet my partner and I still, and frequently reflect fondly on the memory of the experience.

A few highlights were getting sat in the best corner seat in the house, the crispy stuffed chicken wing, the arepa, the staff‚Äôs extra special treatment for our anniversary, and finally the honor of being served by Scully himself as he debuted a new octopus dish.

Scully and his expert team are ahead of their time whilst being exactly where they need to be.

We cannot recommend highly enough that anyone keen to light up their senses and make a lasting memory go for the tasting menu to sample the breadth of wizardry that Scully‚Äôs has to offer. Finally, we weren‚Äôt certain we needed wine with each course, but opting for wine pairing deepened the flavor complexity beyond what we could fathom, elevating the food to stardom.

One thing is guaranteed, you will make a great memory and will not walk away hungry.

I hope to be able to go back soon."
Scully,3.0,"I‚Äôve dined here 30-40 times and have referred this restaurant to many many people. Used to sit at the bar and was very friendly with Chef Scully and his team! The service here - at least tonight - was really not what it used to be. The lady who seated me and took my order had an interesting accent. She was very rude when I asked her in a friendly manner where she was from or what her name was and then proceeded to say ‚Äúno I won‚Äôt tell you‚Äù and went on  to ignore me for the rest of the meal and have another server attend to me. There was zero creepiness or flirting in my ask - same way I‚Äôve asked hundreds of people in my lifetime. Really unprofessional and it made me feel very uncomfortable. This has never happened to me in my life. I travel for work and dine all the time and always have friendly banter with my server or bartender. I used to come here once a month, took a break for the past half a year and was about to resume. I will likely not be back given the very awkward and rude experience with this lady - it really ruined my meal. I‚Äôve never ever been treated like this in my life. The rest of the staff was incredibly friendly so that helped salvage the experience but I still have a weird pit in my stomach from that very odd interaction."
Scully,5.0,"Fantastic food. Amazing range of flavours, and great cocktails too. Really good service too - mentioned a dietary restriction for one of the guests during booking, and all of the staff attending to us were made aware. Admittedly on the pricier side but with excellent food and great service, you certainly get your money‚Äôs worth."
Scully,5.0,Another outstanding meal here. Many new items on the menu to try (the beef cheek rendang is on another level of indulgence!) plus some firm favourites (the arepa and the beef tendons are still amazing!). Impeccable service and great allergy awareness to boot.
Scully,5.0,"What a gem! The food takes fusion to another level. Flavours from across the globe appear together in fantastic combinations. The chef really demonstrates his international heritage and well travelled palate. We sampled 6 different dishes and struggled to pick a standout favourite as all of them were just so good. The parsnip sorbet was a revelation... Friendly, attentive service and very much allergy aware. If you're a MasterChef fan, the chef's counter provides a great view of the pass. Flawless place and now very much on the 'must go again' list!"
Scully,5.0,"Decided to come here for partner‚Äôs birthday after reading all the amazing reviews, we wouldn‚Äôt normally go for ‚Äòfusion‚Äô food but thought give this a try given the chef‚Äôs background. The food was interesting but I wouldn‚Äôt say the flavoring was ground breaking like many others. For me it‚Äôs more like a nostalgic taste and as if eating a combination of childhood flavors. Guess this is still a really nice thing. It‚Äôs fine the place didn‚Äôt recognize the special occasion but we weren‚Äôt impressed by the male staff who served us in the beginning; he was overly indifferent and then too busy chatting up the ladies next to us. Maya was super nice serving us in the end."
Scully,5.0,Truly amazing. We loved every dish. We have eaten at many multi-Michelin starred restaurants and this is up the top of the list. The vegan tasting was better than the OG one (I thought) with the layered celeriac going down as possibly one of the best things I have ever eaten. Thank you!
Scully,5.0,Incredible culinary experience in London! This full open plan style kitchen offers a variety of fusions of cuisines presented into the most umami bites of food. Highly recommend the Arepa and the mushrooms were my favorite.
Scully,5.0,This is without doubt one of my very favourite restaurants in London. The food is exceptional and the service always friendly yet professional. Very good value as well considering the depth of the cookery and quality of ingredients used. Would highly recommend!! üôå ‚Ä¶
Scully,5.0,"Visited with my best friend we both had the vegan tasting menu. The food was excellent in every way but the service elevated everything! From the moment I walked in I was well looked after, I just had to mention the word phone charger and somebody grabbed one plugged it in by my table before I‚Äôd sat down. The service was at the right level of a mixture between formal & relaxed. Out waitress despite only having worked there for 2 weeks was knowledgeable, delivered great conversation and most importantly was passionate about her job.

I‚Äôll be back‚Ä¶next time with my wife for a special occasion."
Scully,5.0,"I booked Scully as a birthday present for my sister, having been recommended it by multiple people. We were not disappointed!

From start to finish, we were completely looked after by our servers Luis & Zaf, and Chef Scully himself. We sat at the table by the kitchen and really feel this enhanced the experience as we got to watch the skill and preparation going into the food, as well as chatting to the Head Chef about the ingredients and flavour combos.

We enjoyed the Vegan Tasting Menu & it was so exciting to be able to eat so much quality vegan food, and not feel these dishes were an afterthought on the menu!

A 10/10 experience that I cannot fault, and cannot wait until we return again!"
Scully,5.0,"Wow if you don't pass by on your holiday, you are missing out! Spend your money here The food is very very good, compliments to the staff!! üç∑"
Scully,5.0,Amazing food. I would definitely recommend going. The staff are understanding and patient and the atmosphere as a whole is fabulous!
Scully,5.0,"Easiest TOP 5 restaurants I‚Äôve ate in London restaurants and I been to a lot of places. Wow, where do I begin... the place is small, but very cozy. The service is excellent, our waitress was so thoughtful, answered all our curious questions about dishes. We had Arepa, Eggplant Sambal, Char-Grilled Broccoli with Salted Egg Yolk, Dry Aged Halibut, a Chicken and Pineapple Creme Br√ªl√©e‚Äôs. Every dish was made to perfection, I‚Äôm usually not a huge fan of Asian Fushion, but I was amazed by all the flavours and how well put together and balanced it was. The prices are high end, but worth it for the quality of food and service. Thank you very much and will be back soon for sure to try rest of the menu."
Scully,5.0,It‚Äôs been an amazing opportunity visiting Scully restaurant. They got really good food with fabulous service and they all were very friendly and helpful. I can‚Äôt wait to visit there again. I highly recommend everyone should visit this restaurant. I can make sure that u gonna love it üòç
Scully,5.0,"I've eaten here a number of times as the menu changes. Some staples like Arepa would cause a riot if removed from the menu, it is so delicious. But new dishes highlight some amazing cuisine, like the pork belly rendang spring rolls."
Scully,4.0,"An enjoyable experience. Overall I thought the food was nice, but wasn‚Äôt necessarily blown away by it. It was good to see there was a range of vegetarian options. The stand outs were the arepa and the green matcha cake but some of the other dishes were a little underwhelming. However the staff was very friendly and offered advice on ordering."
Scully,5.0,Tasting menu is as unique as it gets. Scully gave us a few plates on the house. Service was very personal and on point. One of the best menus I‚Äôve eaten.
Scully,5.0,"My Dinner at Scully St James‚Äôs ‚Äì A Seriously Memorable Meal

I finally got to try Scully in St James‚Äôs last night, and wow I‚Äôm already thinking about when I can go back. Everything about the evening just worked: the setting, the service, and especially the food.

The place has this warm, intimate vibe without being stuffy.There‚Äôs a real energy to the room laid back music, friendly staff, and a sense that you‚Äôre about to eat something a bit different.

We did the three-course menu, and honestly, every dish surprised me in a good way."
Scully,5.0,"Scully is a must-visit for its inventively spiced, globally influenced dishes, charismatic service, and lively open-kitchen setting‚Äîremarkable cooking that justifies the price tag."
Scully,5.0,"Absolutely incredible and sensational food. The texture, flavours and presentation were all incredible but also very innovative. I am a foodie and have been to Scully a few times and the menu is always creative, one of my favourite places in London. Scully is able to combine different flavours in an innovative fashion to bring jt to the next level, combining different Eastern flavours with a slight touch of Mediterranean and the end result is explosively delicious. Service was also impeccable, nice to see a restaurant full of people again post covid. Highly recommend to anyone who loves food."
Scully,5.0,"Wow, I think I am going to be a vegetarian ! So great, rich strong flavours. Amazing. Highly recommend the oyster mushrooms (seriously like a meat dish), arepa (most recommended) and the halibut is as good as well. Lovely. Will come back"
Scully,4.0,"Having opened his own eponymous restaurant, ex-NOPI chef Ramael Scully now has free reins to experiment in both cooking style and ingredients, and the results are stunning in the main, but also rather mixed in parts. The kohlrabi starter was delightful, but the arepa was safe to the point of forgettable. The halibut and stone bass mains both brought out the best in the fish and should be commended. The ice cream and cookie was another 'swing for the fences' dish that came close to being a home run, if not for the miso caramel. The other desserts were good but unremarkable.

The space felt crowded and the acoustics were awful, unfortunately. Our waitress was professional and we appreciated not being rushed to vacated our table after 2 hours 15 minutes - yes they were that specific."
BAO Soho,4.0,"Wanted to try this place for long time. I loved the chicken BAO and scallops in the shell. However, the prawn BAO was too overwhelming as the bread was sweet, and too much garlic ( I‚Äôm a garlic lover by the way) yet this one I couldn‚Äôt eat.
The drink o ordered, salted lemonade was delicious ."
BAO Soho,5.0,"After a very disappointing gastronomic journey in London my partner and I needed a win. BAO soho was exactly that.
Everything was delicious, perfect temperature and great service. Also attention to detail and recommendations from the staff were all spot-on. Would come back easily and look forward to doing so!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"When I went to Bao Soho, despite it being a Saturday I was lucky enough to get a table straight away. I ordered the battered sweet potato, beef rump with white soy, beef cheek nuggets, scallop, confit pork bao, fried chicken bao and prawn bao. I‚Äôve been to 2 other Bao brunches and none of them have disappointed. I love that they all have little variations in their menu which allows me to try different things. I was a big fan of everything  I ordered."
BAO Soho,5.0,Good authentic baos. The 40 day aged beef over rice is a must! Seating capacity is limited to about 30 people so it's best to have a reservation. Staff was friendly and attentive!
BAO Soho,5.0,"The 40 Day Aged Beef Rice was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. So savoury and full of flavour. I would totally recommend you to try that!
And of course the baos also deserve a try, different flavours, all great! Final mention to the exceptional service.

Totally recommend to book in advance, otherwise the wait can be long (~1 hour)"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Booking ahead of time really sped things up. We ordered the beef rice, which was incredible and was ready very quickly after some great starters, the aubergine was a standout in particular.

Great restaurant, will definitely be coming back!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Absolutely blown away by this place! The bao and xiao chi were phenomenal ‚Äî like, flavor explosions in every bite. But the real star of the show? That 40-day aged beef steak rice with egg yolk‚Ä¶ holy hell. Rich, tender, melt-in-your-mouth goodness ‚Äî total game changer.
Cool vibe, super chill staff, and food that hits hard. Already planning my next visit. Do yourself a favor and go."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Great experience. The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äî every bite packed with flavor. Highlights were the eggplant and the eggs. A special shoutout to Everson, who welcomed us with such warmth and made the whole evening even better."
BAO Soho,4.0,"I've been going to Bao in Soho for the best part of 7 years, it's still a must visit and it's still one of my favourite spots in London. (Some notes though)

Bao's Soho branch has been sneakily proving some of London's best food for a while now. The store itself is a quite small, so if you're bigger like me, be prepared. The service makes up for any discomfort easily though, professional waiters on the absolute top of their game. Top marks.

The food has always been good, but some dishes are better than others. The bao, counterintuitivly, is actually not at all the highlight. For me, the blood pudding is as good as it gets; so flavourful, homely and better with the egg yolk. Also, their chicken is fantastic, but nothing will beat the pig trotter nuggets they used to sell.

Worth giving the deserts a shot as well, but be careful because, as good as the food is, it is probably a bit too expensive. Their unique drinks are also worth treating yourself to.

Fair warning, book ahead. You'll be waiting if not. My only note to the restaurant is to pass on the pickled veg, or perhaps wait until the food arrives. It's brilliant picked food, but it has a strong, strong smell.

Of course I'll be back."
BAO Soho,4.0,"I really enjoyed my dining experience here. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.

The baos are AMAZING, definitely try those out.

I had the mushrooms, the balance in the soy sauce was off, making it too sour.

The rice bowl was okay.

The friend chicken is good.

The Taiwanese beer is yum!

The place is expensive and the quantity is slightly less, but it does fill you up.

Would definitely reccomend trying this place out."
BAO Soho,5.0,"I finally got the chance to try Bao after hearing so much about it and it was well worth the wait in the queue!

From the moment I walked in, the experience was fantastic. Special shoutout to Everson, who truly elevated my visit. It was my first time at Bao and he went above and beyond to help me choose what to order. He gave such thoughtful and detailed explanations of the dishes and even shared his personal favorites, which made the whole process feel so warm and welcoming.

I went with the aubergine on his recommendation, and wow. That dish was insane. A 10/10. The sweet notes, paired with a kick of chilli oil, a light crunch from the tempura, and a subtle touch of garlic‚Ä¶ it all just worked. It was beautifully balanced and packed with flavor.

Next up was the fried chicken bao bun, also recommended by Everson, and again, no notes. Perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and so satisfying. Honestly, it hit the spot.

Overall, this was a 10/10 experience. The food was phenomenal, the atmosphere was great, and the service was exceptional. Someone please give Everson a promotion, he absolutely deserves it!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Bao Soho in London serves the best Taiwanese food I‚Äôve ever had! The bao buns are soft, fluffy, and packed with incredible flavor, and the bubble tea is perfectly balanced and refreshing. Every bite feels authentic and made with care. A must-visit for anyone who loves great food!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Really cute spot to have amazing bao! The meet was super juicy, side dishes are super flavourful and the prices are adequate. The staff is very attentive and kind. This was overall a great experience - remember to book your table before coming !"
BAO Soho,4.0,"Service and drinks by the bartender waitress were excellent! Very friendly and warm. Not many bao options in the menu, but the taste was on point and definitely satisfied my asian taste buds. Had the pork bao (that was tender and the right amount of fats) and the fried daikon bao (that was crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside with a nice kick of that spicy sauce). Would definitely by back to try more!"
BAO Soho,5.0,Food came out fast and I loved the flavours of the egg with the mature cheese and egg. Chicken was also crispy and delicious and Horlicks ice cream malty and creamy. A great lunch with delicious flavours.
BAO Soho,5.0,Incredible food and superb service. Very reasonable prices. The scallop was a highlight.
BAO Soho,5.0,"Perfect place for quick lunch with good deal. Top up with a bubble tea, won‚Äôt let you downüßãit would be perfect with an even better texture of the rice"
BAO Soho,4.0,Excellent restaurant. I went because it was in the Michelin guide. Extremely clean and organized. Attentive staff who ask about dietary restrictions. Innovative and delicious menu. Light and fluffy bao buns. Lived up to my expectations. I liked it so much that ended up buying the T-shirt they sell because the recipe book (which was what I really wanted as a souvenir for my trip) was too heavy to carry in my suitcase.
BAO Soho,3.0,"I've eaten food from Bao since it started as market stall in East London. The food used to be so delicious and it has changed quite a bit since then, which is understandable given the expansion and clientele.

I'm very glad Bao is representing Taiwanese food (although the taste of the dishes aren't the same as how they would taste in Taiwan, which is a also a shame) but I wish the food is produced with more love and care.

We ate at Bao Soho and tried the fried squid bao and one of the deep fried chicken steaks. Fried squid bao was not too bad, although meatier squid would have added more colour to the texture. So most of the time, I felt like I was eating deep fried batter instead of squid. The deep fried chicken steak was VERY VERY salty. The texture was OK, and not too dry. The saltiness made it hard to eat though. I'm not sure if everyone who ordered a chicken steak have had the same salty experience. Deep fried chicken steaks in Taiwan are delicious, tender, juicy and definitely not salty!

The main chef (a guy with glasses) had a very bad attitude. We could hear him moaning and talking loudly about a customer's order while we were eating, which ruined the experience for us. It's very unprofessional!

The waiter/waitress were polite and helpful though, which compensated our experience."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Big shoutout to JD and the whole crew at BAO Soho. I had the fried chicken steak, some bao, and the nuggets and honestly, 10/10. That fried chicken steak could solve problems. That lime chilli is something else. The nuggets were massive and the sauces that came with it was crazy good.

Honestly tho, what really made it hit different wasn‚Äôt just the food, but it was the people. JD and the team didn‚Äôt just serve us, they took care of us. The atmosphere was warm, real, and full of good energy. You could feel the heart behind it all. The team was solidddd.

Appreciate the hospitality, the flavours, and the whole experience. I‚Äôll be back for sure, food was crazy good, but the team was hella great!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Superb Bao (hardly surprising) . The peanut on the classic Bao really made it. The chicken and the non alcoholic cocktail choices were excellent. It's a really small place, booking is pretty much essential, even as a solo diner. Otherwise the queue can be quite long(across the street). There are now a number of Baos across London. This is my favourite."
BAO Soho,4.0,"Happened to be around this area so decided to drop by this for a quick lunch. The party of  two queued in front of me got told it‚Äôd be 20 min wait but I got seated pretty quickly on my own. It was busy when I went in around 12:30 and then it went quiet for a bit before the crowd came again.

It was pretty easy to place the order using the QR code and the food came fairly quickly thereafter - I ordered the classic pork and beef brisket bao, as well as the pineapple float. The beef brisket bao wasn‚Äôt listed as spicy on the menu but there was a kick to it, thanks to the refreshing pineapple soda to wash down the chilli, so i definitely preferred the classic pork one with the tasty peanut sauce. Overall I enjoyed the meal but I recommended checking with the staff if you can‚Äôt stand chilli‚Äôs and also visit early as the place isn‚Äôt big and it does get full up easily."
BAO Soho,5.0,Totally worth the hype. Flavors on point. DO make a reservation. The day before was enough. Excellent service.
BAO Soho,4.0,"Food portion is small, as the limited space as it is in the restaurant. Staff is very nice. Somewhere that is suitable for trying something out for the first time."
BAO Soho,5.0,One of the best service ever! Foods and drinks are very unique and perfect.
BAO Soho,4.0,"I recently had dinner at this restaurant, and I left thoroughly impressed. The service was both efficient and friendly, with a team that was attentive and welcoming.

The ¬£15 menu is excellent value for money. It includes a bao of your choice, which was absolutely delicious, followed by crispy chicken that was perfectly crunchy and flavorful. The meal was rounded off with a bowl of rice and guinea fowl, which was well-prepared and packed with taste. Every dish was well-balanced and satisfying.

For dessert, I couldn‚Äôt resist the Fried Chocolate Ice Cream. It was a true indulgence, with the perfect balance of crisp and creamy textures.

I highly recommend this restaurant for a simple, tasty, and affordable meal!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Superb place! Easily the best Bao I‚Äôve had, the Kale salad and aubergine were delicious."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Excellent cuisine! The fried chicken is delicious and absolutely worth trying. The bao buns are also very tasty. The only downside is that the space is quite small, and the wall hooks for coats aren‚Äôt ideally placed‚Äîwhen they‚Äôre full, they can be a bit uncomfortable and get in the way. Aside from this minor issue, the overall experience is fantastic. The flavors are authentic, and the dishes are well-prepared. Friendly and attentive staff make the visit even more enjoyable. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a great meal in a cozy setting!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Great food, great service and was affordable! Ate out in London constantly for 3 days and this place was our favourite! Good veggie/ vegan options too."
BAO Soho,5.0,Everything was so delicious and served as soon as it was ready so the temperatures were perfect (especially the horlicks ice cream bao). Super nice service too!
BAO Soho,4.0,"LUNAR NEW YEAR FEAST üßßü•¢
üìç Soho, London
‚≠êÔ∏è 4/5
üí∏ ¬£¬£

To ring in the Chinese Lunar New Year, we headed to our go-to spot, @bao_london‚Äîthis time in Soho. We were hoping to try their exclusive Year of the Snake menu, only to realize this location didn‚Äôt have it üò¢. But hey, no complaints‚Äîwe made up for it by going all in!

We started with their Classic BAO, fried chicken, and melt-in-your-mouth beef short rib‚Äîeach one as good as ever. Then, we couldn‚Äôt resist some specials, including the honey-glazed pork bao (sweet, sticky perfection) and the Snake Bao with pistachio cream to finish on a sweet note.

Even without the special menu, it was a proper feast‚ÄîBao never disappoints! ü•¢üî•"
BAO Soho,5.0,"If you don‚Äôt mind the short wait to be seated, it‚Äôs an incredible experience for the food and Asian atmosphere."
BAO Soho,5.0,Everything in this place is just ‚Äúmust-try‚Äù ! I loved the foods I tried. The staffs were so friendly and polite.
BAO Soho,5.0,Super delicious! Food is incredible. And Jade from the staff is the loveliest person you‚Äôll ever meet.
BAO Soho,5.0,"Delicious BAO buns, you can see them being freshly made and taste so good. We tried the pork bao which was incredible"
BAO Soho,5.0,Such a good place to eat! And now we have crossed this place off our bucket list.
BAO Soho,5.0,"Bao! Darling Bao!!! ü©∑ what a sweet little spot to have lunch/dinner/whatever! the baos are sooo worth it, likely the best you can get in London. I would say the best one by far is the beef short rib bao, tastes like an elevated hamburger, melt-in-your-mouth texture, packed with sweet n savoury flavour. The other two were very good but didn‚Äôt blow me away as they were not super distinct.

The sides were all good, I was most impressed by the pickles which are a MUST if you liked pickled things! I think they switch the veggies up once in a while as well so you get to try what‚Äôs in season. I thought the aubergine could‚Äôve had a bit more deep-sweet sauciness and the rice a bit more salt but yum! The fresh cucumber was a lovely addition.

The drinks also!!! Let‚Äôs not understate them! The grape-ade is unbelievable, the perfect sourness and the grape flavour is indulgently candy-like, but it‚Äôs fizzy and makes it both childish and refined, an impressive balance. Only little sad thing is that they didn‚Äôt have green tea but that‚Äôs ok because the tea was still tasty üíï

Overall such a recommend, so worth it!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Super delicious food and at a very good price for the quality that they offer. They are also very kind and efficient. Overall, a great experience"
BAO Soho,4.0,"The service was exceptional‚Äîstaff were friendly, efficient, and made us feel very welcome. The food was fantastic, living up to the high expectations set by its reputation. Each dish was a flavorful adventure, particularly the signature baos, which were perfectly balanced in taste and texture.

However, the dining space is quite confined, which can make it feel a bit cramped, especially during peak hours. Additionally, it was quite hot inside, which detracted somewhat from the overall comfort. Despite these minor inconveniences, the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and service you receive.

In summary, Bao offers excellent food and great service at good prices, but the limited space and heat inside are areas that could use some improvement."
BAO Soho,4.0,"Came here for a post-work dinner with a friend.  I booked ahead knowing from the pictures how small this place was.  We arrived at 17:30 in the evening and unfortunately there were no tables available so we sat at the counter facing the bar.  As I learned later on, it wasn't ideal being right next to a sink as water from the sink often splashed up onto us.

However, moving on from that we ordered our drinks both cocktails, I had the sake beer and my companion the sweet potato gin.  Both were excellently prepared.  Tap water was requested and provided as a bottle with two glasses for us to fill.

As we were ordering before 6pm, we managed to take advantage of the ¬£15 set menu which was a side, bao bun and rice bowl.  The choices weren't great but what was there was enough for us to go for it.  Bao wise we got a Classic and Fried Chicken, for the sides we got the mushroom and fried chicken and both rice bowls which were aubergine and guinea fowl.  The bao's were excellent as you can expect, especially the buns themselves, they were fluffy warm and soft holding their fillings perfectly.  The fillings themselves were great and went down very easily!  I could've had many more.

The sides were good, but nothing amazing.  Fried chicken wasn't winning any awards and the mushrooms were made better with the small pieces of pickled shitake mushrooms which massively elevated the dish.  The rice bowls were ok, the guinea fowl was probably lost on me as it just tasted like gamey rice with a hint of richness from the egg yolk.  I personally preferred the aubergine rice more but again, nothing crazy and there were no particular flavours shouting out.

I decided to order the weeping Sake which was smooth dry and delicious and we got a couple of more buns, one classic and one braised shortrib.  No complaints on those, both delicious as you would expect from a place named 'Bao'

Overall a good place to get tasty and authentic bao buns but not somewhere I'd visit again as all the other dishes seem a bit pointless to me.  Just do more bao buns please!!

Also due to the quick turnaround at this place it did feel quite rushed and the food was coming out too quickly would you believe!  Yes, there is such a thing as food arriving at the table too quickly!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"I had a lovely solo meal here this evening. The fried chicken bao and the 49 day aged beef rice were really tasty, the perfect amount of food for 1 person. I want to say a special thanks for the lady who was working as front of house this evening. She was very kind and helpful and made my meal even better. Thank you!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Maitre d was fantastic. Our table was not quite ready for allocated time, he seated us at the bar and sorted our drinks whilst the table was cleaned. Staff were all polite, friendly and knowledgeable. Food was amazing. For the price point this place is fantastic and highly recommend any who hasn‚Äôt been to book ASAP. Our only feedback would be some low level music in the background would add a little more ambience."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Interior of this place never disappoints, small but very cute. It is pricey but the food is filling and delicious. Very surprised with the aubergine, thought it wouldn‚Äôt be that nice but absolutely loved the flavours.

Service is quick and very helpful from when you come in and when you leave too. Beautiful staff"
BAO Soho,5.0,amazing food & super lovely staff! would absolutely come back and recommend :-)
BAO Soho,4.0,First time trying BAO & loved my meal (the beef rice dish & the chicken bao). But the best part was Francine (I believe her name is) she was one of the waiting staff. So lovely & charming while managing the queue/wait. She walked me through the menu perfectly w/great recommendations. Just perfect service from her (didn‚Äôt interact w/others but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre lovely too). Food took a while too but she made sure to address that too w/ me.
BAO Soho,3.0,The lunch set is a nice way to sample 3 different dishes. I liked the pickled and grilled mushrooms. It was perfect if you don‚Äôt want something heavy. It had a nice sweet and slightly pickled flavor which paired well with the smokiness from the grill. The confit pork bao was a bit dry and it was lacking flavor. I was expecting rich pork flavors but it was subtle and there wasn‚Äôt too much sauce on top. The rice bowl had simple flavors as well.
BAO Soho,5.0,Food is delicious. The shrimps bao is excellent. A background music would have made the atmosphere more interesting. Great experience overall
BAO Soho,5.0,Delicious baos. We tried quite a few; favorites ones were the classic and fried chicken. The lemonade with milk foam was also amazing! We queued up by giving phone number and 15 minutes later got texted with available table. Very smooth and nice process
BAO Soho,4.0,"Good food, great service, pricing feels a bit high now compared to a few years ago."
BAO Soho,5.0,Top experience. Baos take you to heaven. Highly recommended!!!!! Order black pudding - don‚Äôt be scared
BAO Soho,5.0,"Both the food and the service were exceptional. It was our first  time, but we'll be back."
BAO Soho,5.0,"I arrived with my son. Service, excellent. Food extremely tasty and very well presented."
BAO Soho,5.0,Would recommended the chicken nuggets and fried chicken bao.
BAO Soho,5.0,Tiny but very nice. Our waitress could not be nicer (Jade?). Thanks to her for her kindness. We ordered two daily menus. Amount of food was not awesome but we did not finish lunch being hungry. I'ld go back. I'ld suggest to improve the bathroom but considering the little space you have I guess it's impossible.
BAO Soho,5.0,The boa buns were really nice! Had the pleasure of trying 4 different flavours and they were tasty. Lemon and honey ice tea was very refreshing. Would definitely recommend for a quick snack.
BAO Soho,5.0,"We stopped in here for lunch between museum visits.  Small compact place with efficient friendly service.  We had the kale salad and 4 different kinds of Bao.  We had the classic, duck, beef short rib and crispy fried chicken. Really enjoyed all our baos and the kale salad.  Highly recommend stopping here."
BAO Soho,5.0,"I‚Äôve been wanting to try this place for so long and finally did it during my trip. I really enjoyed the food here, not only everything I ordered tasted delicious, it also reminds me home. My fav was the beef soup, scallop, sliced beef and rice bowl."
BAO Soho,5.0,Tight quarters but quick service. Nice server in middle for conversation if you‚Äôre willing. Food came out very fast. Bao buns were delicious and the drink selection was great. Would come back
BAO Soho,5.0,"Small & cosy environment with friendly staffs. Although it is on the pricier side, the food was really good! Really love the fried holick ice-cream bao ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Do try the Pineapple float & their bubble tea!. We visited the soho outlet :)"
BAO Soho,5.0,Very delightful dinner and the service was quite perfect!
BAO Soho,5.0,We were here 2 hours ago for my daughter‚Äôs birthday and pre-theatre meal. Absolutely faultless! Excellent food and service. Would definitely come back!
BAO Soho,5.0,Seamless reservation experience online 1 day prior and promptly seated upon arrival- absolutely delicious food and did not have to wait long for it - would return again
BAO Soho,5.0,"The food was delicious and well made, we really enjoyed it!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Another favourite of mine. 10/10 as always. The mapo aubergine is completely out of this world, one of the tastiest things I‚Äôve ever had, cast iron 10/10. Pork belly bao also wild. Please have a beer too, one of the best, another 10/10. Would highly recommend this joint."
BAO Soho,5.0,"The only downside to this is that they don‚Äôt have that many to choose from, however, what they offer is yummy and delicious anyway!
Went with my friend and we got the aubergine with wonton crisps, sweet potato fries, and from the buns we got the classic, pork, and chicken and they were so good - the bun was fluffy and the filling was so flavourful. Really great combination of flavours.

You usually have to wait for some time but that‚Äôs not surprising considering the restaurant‚Äôs location, and who would mind waiting for great quality food?

Plus, have you seen their website?! What a masterpiece!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Loved it! What a great combination of flavours! The duck, the pork, the fried chicken, very very nice! Portions are small and it's a good thing, because you can order a lot of small plates and enjoy so many flavours.

There is always a queue so better get there early, staff is friendly and there is no rush despite being packed.

Definitely a place to go back again."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Friendly staff, great food üòÉ Enjoyed x Baolicious!"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Always an amazing time in any Bao. Superb food, lovely friendly service and great vibes"
BAO Soho,5.0,"Bao London is my go-to spot whenever I'm craving delicious Taiwanese cuisine with a modern twist.

With locations scattered across the city, it‚Äôs the perfect place to enjoy a range of Taiwanese delights, whether you‚Äôre dining in or grabbing a quick bite to-go.

The menu is a fantastic mix of traditional and modern flavors. I highly recommend trying the xiao chi (small bites) and noodles, but the real stars of the show are their signature BAOs.

The classic bao and prawn bao are absolutely worth the wait‚Äîthere are few things in life worth queueing for, but these definitely are!

The pillowy buns and perfectly balanced fillings make each bite an explosion of flavor.
If you‚Äôre a fan of bubble tea, their drink options are a great accompaniment to your meal.

Bao London never disappoints. It‚Äôs a staple for me, and once you try it, it‚Äôll likely be one for you too!"
BAO Soho,5.0,I guess the queue outside somehow leverages my expectation on this restaurant. I dropped in for a light meal after school. I didn‚Äôt wait so long to be seated at the bar once it opened thanks to I am a solo-traveler. Small shop but serving promptly delicious tasty bao. I would ordered for some more if I wasn't go alone. Will definitely be back next time I am in the capital with my husband
BAO Soho,5.0,We loved the food and atmosphere! Definitely recommend it
BAO Soho,4.0,"The BAO that started it all - I remember the queue snaking around the corner just to get in just a few years back, which is luckily no longer the case - but do book in advance. While the food is still excellent, I can‚Äôt help but feel that success has dimmed this chain‚Äôs light.

Everything we had was delicious, especially the pickles, bao buns, and aubergine dip; also, the sauce next to the nuggets was out of this world - I‚Äôd have a whole plate of it if it was an option. The drinks were nice - we had the yakult float and peanut milk; I‚Äôd recommend the latter for dessert as it‚Äôs quite sweet.

So why the lost star? First, portion size - the dishes are tiny and entirely unsuitable for sharing. Even the ‚Äúlarger‚Äù ones, like the Guinea fowl bowl, had barely any fowl and provided maybe five bites between the two of us. Very little value for money. Secondly, the service - some of the starters came so late we‚Äôd already finished our mains, and the waiters never came to check in on us. It took about 20 minutes before we were even approached. And lastly, our seats were low, uncomfortable, and in the way of the staff.

So while BAO continues to offer top-notch Taiwanese in the capital, I‚Äôm afraid the customer is no longer at the heart of what they do. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre doing well, but the experience was alienating - and I‚Äôve been to several BAO locations so can sadly say it‚Äôs this way across the board. Here‚Äôs hoping they remember why they started the place - to give people yummy food and introduce their culture to the world."
BAO Soho,5.0,"Very good, very cozy (the place is small ish but I felt like we had our little bubble)
The staff was very nice and helped us choose our plates. It was my first time ever and we got out of there with belly and heart full. Part of my highlight while visiting London"
BAO Soho,5.0,Really tasty bao buns. If you‚Äôre coming at peak hours you may have to book a table or wait a while in line. You can always take them away with you like we did. The service is also really friendly and it‚Äôs a great price for London.
BAO Soho,5.0,"Sitting here writing my review before I leave. Every single member of staff provided a wonderful level of customer service, which was met by an equally wonderful level of food. Well done! Fantastic experience!!!"
Luca,5.0,"The fried potato was unexpectedly great, would highly recommend them as well as the scallops which were cooked perfectly complemented by the sauce. The pastas were also well presented and tasty but I did find them too salty.

The interior is beautiful and service is excellent as expected. Would be a great place for special occasions."
Luca,5.0,"I‚Äôve been to my fair share of Michelin star restaurants and Luca deservedly stands amongst the best in London. From the service, to the interior design/decor, all the way to the food. Attention to detail is something that is clearly drilled into the entire staff. The level of care and professionalism provided such a relaxed and memorable dining experience. We went for the Chefs Menu for 3 guests and every course was close to being faultless. It was a fine example of simplicity done right with fresh ingredients and textures. I found myself asking the waiter about certain elements in each course that caught my attention as I was eating.
As you would expect, the waiting staff was informative and attentive. It‚Äôs visibly obvious to see that the standards are set very high and it was hard for me to find faults with the service at any point.
Whenever I find similarities in specific dishes that I‚Äôve had elsewhere, I tend to play the comparison game. Before going to Luca, the best fine dining pork dish I‚Äôd had was at Trinity in Clapham. On the chefs menu they served us a pork dish with beans and apricots. To say this was the standout dish by mile is an understatement, officially making it the best pork dish I‚Äôve ever had. This is the true level of Michelin and it‚Äôs exactly what brings customers back for more.

Highly recommend"
Luca,5.0,"It‚Äôs a superb place - amazing ambience. Is loud but not very loud. I was here with a client. Was fun. Food was top quality and service was good.

If I had to pick one suggestion / improvement - the staff appeared to be pressurizing with respect to ordering wine. Like trying to fill the glass more quickly than we desire as then we would have to order a new bottle. This sometimes felt a bit odd. But otherwise delighted with everything I saw and received."
Luca,4.0,"ITALIAN MICHELIN MAGIC üáÆüáπ‚ú®
üìç Clerkenwell, London
‚≠êÔ∏è 5/5
üí∏ ¬£¬£¬£¬£
üç¥Craving a proper Italian fine dining experience? @lucarestaurant is that place. From the moment you step inside this stunning Clerkenwell spot, housed in a beautifully restored 18th-century building, you know you're in for something special. Awarded a #MichelinStar, it brings Italian cooking into the modern age, balancing elegance with comfort and tradition with creativity üî•
We went for their set menu and honestly, every single course felt like a masterpiece. Top highlights? The Roast Orkney #Scallops with Jerusalem artichoke and ‚Äònduja: rich, spicy, and perfectly cooked. The #Parmesan Fries? Unexpected, crispy, cheesy heaven. And let‚Äôs talk about the LUCA #Tiramis√π, hands down the best I‚Äôve had in #London, creamy, bold, and just sweet enough ü§§ If you're after a refined foodie moment, this place nails it. The service is warm, the vibe is chic but not pretentious, and the food? Impeccable ‚≠êÔ∏è"
Luca,5.0,"Good italian restaurant - there were indoor and outdoor seatings. Place was quite full - reservation is highly recommended.

Service was great - I celebrated my birthday here, and there were nice gestures which included a birthday card from the restaurant, as well as a small canape with birthday candle. Server was attentive and explained the food well, which included pointing out foods that don't meet our dietary restrictions.

Food was superb - we had parmesan fries, burrata, cured stone bass, prawn spaghetti, pesto tortellini, lemon tart, and affogato. Our favorite was the parmesan fries and stone bass. Wait time was a bit long, but the food was worth it. There was a selection of good drinks too."
Luca,5.0,"We came to Luca to celebrate my mom‚Äôs birthday and had a wonderful experience. The restaurant is cozy with a warm, welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff.

The food was absolutely delicious‚Äîjust as we had hoped. Their spin on Cacio e Pepe was especially amazing, full of rich flavor with a unique twist.

A great spot for a special occasion or a nice night out. Highly recommend!"
Luca,5.0,"Wanted to try this place for ages since it gained a star, and the lunch did not disappoint. Opted for the (unconventional!) signature Parmesan fries, cured bass, beef fillet, and tiramisu. Tiramisu was standout - as was the delicious and delicate Luca martini. Will definitely return to try more of the menu!"
Luca,5.0,"Tucked just up the road from Farringdon and Smithfield, Luca delivers modern Italian dining with real finesse.

Opened in 2016 and awarded its well-deserved Michelin star in 2021, it‚Äôs an ideal choice for a refined yet efficient lunch in the heart of Clerkenwell.

The interior blends contemporary bistro style with thoughtful design. On entry, you‚Äôll find cubicle-style seating on the left and a bar on the right with a direct view into the open kitchen. The main dining room is in a separate space‚Äîfeaturing mid-century-style wooden and leather banquettes, glass partitions for privacy, Zaragoza pendant lighting, and a generous lightwell that fills the room with warmth.

I went for the express lunch menu‚Äîexcellent value at ¬£32 for two courses or ¬£38 for three.

Starter: Fried Jerusalem Artichoke with King Oyster Mushroom and Roscoff Onion
Beautifully grilled artichokes were topped with a punchy red pepper and onion salsa, alongside meaty mushrooms enhanced by a rich moderno sauce. Every bite offered smoky depth and umami‚Äîan outstanding and generous starter.

Main: John Dory with Grezzina Courgette, Yellow Raisins, and a Saffron & Kaffir Lime Bisque
This dish was a visual and flavourful delight. The John Dory was perfectly cooked, set atop a vibrant bisque that echoed the richness of lobster, balanced with the fragrant lift of kaffir lime and tomato. The sweetness of the raisins and courgette salsa contrasted beautifully, though the courgette strips leaned a touch salty. Nonetheless, a standout plate in both portion and presentation.

Dessert: Tiramisu
Enormous! A cloud of mascarpone cream over sponge, indulgent enough for two to share. Classic, rich, and satisfying.

Service was brisk and professional‚Äîstart to finish in under an hour, making it ideal for a high-quality working lunch. The only minor gripe was the automatic 15% service charge even for bar seating.

One note: the toilets could use an aesthetic refresh to match the otherwise polished surroundings."
Luca,5.0,"Such a fantastic restaurant. The restaurant was beautifully done, such a light space that is really enjoyable to sit in and enjoy your meal. The Al-Fresco dining option also looked perfect for a sunny day. The service was great, the staff were all very attentive without the feeling of trying to rush you out. For starters we got the bread and olive oil, the Parmesan fries, the burrata and pea dish, and the salami/charcuterie style board. All were faultless and I would order them all again. For the mains I got the pork, anchovy and mint ragu pasta - the sauce was tasty and flavourful and the pasta was perfectly made and cooked. I genuinely have no complaints about this restaurant, it was a great meal. I would warn that it is expensive though, expect to spend over ¬£100 so it‚Äôs definitely not an everyday place. I would love to return."
Luca,5.0,"I‚Äôve been wanting to try Luca for quite some time now and it certainly lived up to my high expectations!
We enjoyed the special August Ferragosto Chef‚Äôs menu and loved every dish.
It was a good amount of dishes and a really great way to try many different elements of the a la carte menu plus some options not available a la carte.
We sat in the terrace area and it was such a lovely vibe.
Thank you to the staff for all their friendly service and extra special touches for our birthday celebration."
Luca,5.0,We booked a table for lunch on a Saturday and really enjoyed the experience. The staff were very attentive and the attention to detail was incredible. All the courses came quickly and we were impressed by how calm and intimate the atmosphere was despite almost every table being booked. We were celebrating a birthday and it was definitely a special occasion.
Luca,4.0,I absolutely loved the food here! The cacio e Pepe dish was absolutely incredible and the Parmesan fries were so soft and delicious! The wine bottle we had was gorgeous and I could not recommend this place enough! It was stunning. I did not like the tiramisu though as it was just pure cream which I thought was inauthentic
Luca,5.0,"By far the best Italian restaurant in London. It got a Michelin star for an absolute reason.

The food the perhaps the best I‚Äôve had in my life, especially the Parmesan chips, which are by far the best dish I‚Äôve ever tasted.

For two consecutive visits to London I must say eating at Luca made them better. The rabbit tagliatelle and agnolotti are very recommended.

The wine selection is very good and service is excellent. The atmosphere is not an advantage in my opinion, being too modern.

Go to Luca and have as many Parmesan chips as you possibly can!"
Luca,4.0,"Fine dining without any pretentiousness in a quiet neighborhood on a holiday weekend.
Quite a large space with charming ambiance.
The bread was delicious!"
Luca,5.0,"A fantastic food experience.
I would strongly recommend the chef menu. Fantastic combination of flavours and also great service. Special thanks to Mattia and Luigi for the great service and for walking us through this amazing food/wine journey"
Luca,5.0,Michelin 1 star restaurant. Very vibrant and good business. Services is good. Tiramisu and Afagato both were excellent. Good wine list. Highly recommended.
Luca,5.0,"Had their bar express lunch, exceed my expectations and I‚Äôll for sure come back for their dinner menu!

I liked their Parmesan fries and starter (the green pasta) the most, the right flavour and delicate. The fries do get a bit too heavy if you‚Äôre eating on your own! So best to share it with someone.
The cod is rlly tender but I didn‚Äôt like the sauce much.
The tiramisu SLAYED too, not sweet, very creamy and airy, big portion.

Does get a bit crowded since it‚Äôs a lunchtime during weekdays, but it won‚Äôt be too uncomfortable cuz people are spaced out nicely."
Luca,3.0,"Luca didn't quite live up to the expectations for us. Positives - staff were very really friendly and attentive (and all remembered the special event we had noted in our reservation), the ambiance in the restaurant was wonderful and we enjoyed their cocktails. The melt-in-your-mouth parmesan fries and the burrata set our dinner off to a strong start - the burrata especially had a fantastic contrast of textures and flavours. Sadly the tortellini in crema were overpowered by the cream sauce they were swimming in, making the entire dish monotunous and quickly overwhelming. It then took over 45 minutes to receive our mains. While the staff came over to apologise for our wait, it wasn't a great experience to see our neighbouring table, seated after us, being served much more quickly. When it finally arrived our venison was well cooked, but every component in the dish felt overly salted - even the poached fruit (pears?) which had wonderful spice notes were so salty they failed to balance out the other elements. All in all it took three hours to serve starters, primi and secondi, and we ended up skipping dessert because of it. They proactively removed the parmesan fries (¬£9) and some chocolates they had brought us off the bill, but we rather would have enjoyed our meal at normal pacing."
Luca,5.0,Went here for a birthday meal and was blown away by the staff and food. The one thing I hate about Michelin star places are the portion sizes. They are too small. This place was different and I felt the standard and size of the food delivered. This was my second time here and I will return. Well done Luca.
Luca,4.0,"I enjoyed the atmosphere of Italy in London! Lovely staff especially Lucy was a really warm hearted staff. She gave me a very special and sweet treat for welcoming me! Green pesto pasta was very fresh. Cheese sticks were very cheesy and light texture with softness. And they have a very kind and professional bartender too. Recommend to someone who want to enjoy fresh Italian cuisine. I‚Äôll visit again! (If I remember the wrong name of the staff gave me welcome treatment, I‚Äôm sorry!)"
Luca,5.0,"Really enjoyed the set menu here today. The staff were very attentive with no inclination to rush you through courses. Our waiter Cashel was just fantastic-polite, informative and helpful. Lovely restaurant, great atmosphere and wonderful set menu, all dishes were delicious! Thanks. Have already made another reservation for this lovely restaurant."
Luca,5.0,Me and my partner had her birthday dinner here. Great food especially the lamb and dessert.
Luca,5.0,"Luca Italian Restaurant exceeded all expectations. The service was truly out of the curve‚Äîimpeccable and attentive in every detail. The Italian food is unbelievably good, showcasing the authenticity and craftsmanship behind every dish. I had the ravioli with black truffles, and it was simply crazy good‚Äîone of the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. The environment is equally astonishing, combining elegance with warmth to create the perfect dining atmosphere. It‚Äôs no surprise they earned a Michelin star in 2023; they completely deserve it. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a top-tier Italian dining experience!"
Luca,1.0,"Great staff at the restaurant, good atmosphere, food was below average. It‚Äôs dressed up as a nice restaurant, but the food plays very pedestrian. Reminded me of food on an airplane. Booked in here for a post-engagement dinner. Got severe food poisoning. Had to go to A&E, docs confirmed it was likely from bad seafood. Notified staff, they could not have cared less. Kind of ruined this special occasion. Would not recommend. Beautiful space, but everything else unfortunately was grim."
Luca,5.0,"The tortellini of mortadella with wild garlic broth is amazing. I would recommend it for sure. Besides, burrata and scallops are the highlighted dishes to me. Also good service and ambience."
Luca,4.0,"I booked Luca a few weeks ago, as my mom was in town. First impression: the space is incredible, it‚Äôs designed with such taste, absolute perfection. We ordered champagne to start the evening, which took ages to be served. Staff came twice to apologise. Not sure where they were getting the champagne from but anyway. Starters arrived swiftly, then again, ages to get our main. Staff apologised again. We had a couple on the table next to ours which didn‚Äôt seem to wait for anything, drinks or food, and seem to get extra attention (regulars maybe?), I sound a bit annoyed but it feels slightly weird to have people treated differently in a restaurant. That being said, the food was absolutely incredible. The seafood pasta was especially delicious. The other thing that bothered us was‚Ä¶ the toilet. Weird to mention maybe, but I was expecting toilets as nice as the restaurant, especially in a michelin star restaurant. I had to leave the toilet and come back in to make sure I took the right door. This part hasn‚Äôt been renovated it seems, and most of all it wasn‚Äôt very clean. That‚Äôs a bit of a pity because the food was completely overshadowed by the experience. We stayed almost 2h just for a starter and a main. As much as the food was lovely, I will not come back."
Luca,3.0,"Food was good, think the pasta was not as good as I hoped but not bad by any means.
Scallops changed my life, I think of them every day and absolutely no notes on them.
Vibe of the restaurant was welcoming, cool and fun.
Service was less than desired for a Michelin star and for the price we paid. It wasn‚Äôt terrible, but felt like service you‚Äôd get from the local high street restaurant not a top rated London restaurant. Especially with an automatic 18% tip on the bill for mediocre service."
Luca,4.0,"Had the spring surprise menu - overall, excellent food. Service was friendly but I wouldn‚Äôt say professional - numerous waiters would ask for our drinks order even thought we‚Äôd ordered, food taken away when wasn‚Äôt quite finished. Found the beef disappointing - had asked for medium done, came chewy and well done. Lovely ambience and vibe though."
Luca,4.0,"Lovely restaurant! Delicious food, good service ! The food took a lot of time to get to our table but it was worth it and to be fair they gave us fair warning that it will take atleast 30 -45 minutes to get the food.
We were out in the garden and it was a beautiful day !! Loved the rusty decor and would recommend anyone looking for some good italian to enjoy ! Check out photos of the food!"
Luca,5.0,Great food at this Michelin restaurant. Highly recommend the ribeye.
Luca,5.0,Fantastic place with delicious food and attentive service! All the dishes and desserts were amazing! Highly recommend and will be back!
Luca,4.0,Fantastic starters and excellent food mainly. . Good service - a little too quick between courses. Would have been 5 stars but the pasta was swimming in oil which ruined a great dish. However will definitely return.
Luca,5.0,Great choices and super good service. Attentive menus for different allergies and intolerances. Decor is super nice and understated. Scrumptious food and prices to match
Luca,5.0,"Got the lunch menu twice (shared with someone), everything was overall great. The ham steak was my least favorite, and also the fish, the first courses and desserts were much better. Also the parmesan fries were phenomenal. Overall a very good lunch"
Luca,5.0,"I was there three times and I can say is an amazing Italian food in London.
Detail-oriented, attentive staff, delicious food, deserts and wine list.
I love it!"
Luca,5.0,"It was a last minute visit for lunch. Our flights to France were cancelled so we decided to have a nice lunch. This was a surprisingly, beautifully and deliciously lovely lunch. We enjoyed every course. Service and atmosphere both perfect as well"
Luca,5.0,"Utterly magnificent. I have had the good fortune to eat in thousands of restaurants, nothing beats Luca. Apart from suggesting you start with the exceptional Parmesan fries you should order what you like, everything is amazing. The presentation is superb and the flavours are fresh and complex. Every member of staff seemed one step ahead and made each of us feel valued. Simply astonishing. The lighting, temperature seating and decor was perfect."
Luca,5.0,"Very highly recommended - I'd had this restaurant on my list of places to try for a good few years, and am pleased to say the wait was worth it. Lovely ambiance and decor, superb food, deep Italian wine list, overall an excellent experience."
Luca,5.0,"A more casual Michelin starred restaurant offering really good Italian inspired dishes. The pasta dishes are well balanced and the main courses are on point. There is no doubt you will get food here. My main comment is on the atmosphere, the background music was rock and roll with upbeat tracks. It doesn't go well with the refined high quality dishes in front of you. I'm still giving overall 5 stars because they can easily change the playlist üëç"
Luca,5.0,The restaurant is bigger than it looks with plenty of tables at the back and showing an open kitchen. Service was top notch. And so were the dishes. The bread is made on the day and you can really tell the difference. On the expensive side. The ambience is perfect for a date or even a small gathering.
Luca,5.0,"Good Italian wine selection. Food was extremely well made. Mushroom antipasti and steak were the highlights for me. It‚Äôs on the pricey side but quality of food and service were excellent.

Everything we had was well balanced. Highly recommend you to reserve a slot in their open air area at the back for beautiful way to enjoy LONDON summer day !!"
Luca,5.0,"Quite possibly one of my favorite meals! The atmosphere. Service, and food were all stellar. The food was dynamic and flavorful, keeping its authentic flavors, while not being overly heavy. Portions were very well served. The wine list both by the glass and bottle are interesting, selected thoughtfully, nicely priced and offer a great variety for every palette."
Luca,5.0,"The most amazing Wedding Meal!!!

We dined at Luca in June 2025 for our wedding meal. Beforehand we communicated seamlessly with Silver (who was sensational) and planned our big day.

We ate in the Terrace which was dressed beautifully for us.

Special recognition needs to go to Cameron and his team on the night who's service and attention to detail was the best we have ever experienced.  They really made our evening the most special it could be.

The food is divine, the courses and wine served promptly.

Is this the best restaurant in London?  Most definitely."
Luca,5.0,"It was the second Michelin starred restaurant we tried. We went there for lunch, we were a party of 5 for the bar express menu. Keep in mind they only have tables for 4, so we split our reservation into a group of 3 and 2 of us stayed at the bar, the groups of 2 are always seated at the bar. But we kind of enjoyed this vibe. The drinks are very good and nicely presented. We paired a negroni and a spritz with the parmesan fries which are really interesting. We took the 3 course menu. The appetizer with the jersualem artichoke was to die for, an explosion of tastes left you speechless for a couple of seconds while you tried to figure out what is it exactly you ate. For the mains both of them were very nice, the 3 fishes came with a nice bouillabaisse, a bit almondy for my taste but still it paired nicely. The beef was really tasty and tender for a cut of beef that was not ribeye or fillet. The tiramisu was perfectly executed but the star of dessert was the Panna Cotta with rhubarb. Would gladly return here to try the full tasting menu"
Luca,4.0,"We had a fun date night here but it wasn‚Äôt quite up to the level we felt its reputation and long standing establishment would suggest. Good ingredients and some excellent dishes (the rib eye and tiramisu were excellent - the pastas less so).

The service meanwhile started well as we were obligingly given, after requesting, a better table that was sitting empty, in a far from full restaurant. But then it promptly disappeared thanks to a permanently uninterested waitress, eye rolling at all customers when she thought no-one was looking. It was an insult to both the customers and the restaurant itself. Awkward and uncomfortable."
Luca,5.0,Spent my birthday having lunch at Luca. The Parmesan Fries and Roast Orkney Scallops are must-orders. The whole staff were very friendly and accommodating but special shoutout to Ida who provided world-class service. Will definitely be back soon.
Luca,3.0,"Had high expectations given the Michelin star but was fairly disappointed.

The chefs menu was a strange combination of dishes (burrata for starters and then stracciatella as primi) and not their most inspiring sounding dishes. The primi was well plated but very bland and flavourless and the dessert was probably nowhere near as nice as the other options on the menu (we saw the other desserts on other tables). Nothing was actively wrong with the food, aside from being overpriced.

The service was quite rushed (drinks were almost taken away before finishing etc) and not especially friendly. We could hardly hear what was on out plates. Also no one asked to take our coats or double checked on allergies etc.

Overall: the restaurant is very nicely decorated and the food is not bad but for the price I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôd recommend it."
Luca,5.0,"I‚Äôd go as far as saying Luca is my favourite winter restaurant in London. Been many times now and the food is always amazing. Cater to my gluten, dairy, egg free diet perfectly. If you can dine on a week day be sure to book the set menu in the bar area ( ask for a booth) brilliant value for money!"
Luca,5.0,"From the moment I stepped into this hidden gem on 88 St John Luca, I knew I was in for something special. The atmosphere is effortlessly elegant, blending modern charm with a cozy warmth that instantly makes you feel at home. But the real magic? It's on the plate.

Every dish was a masterpiece  beautifully presented, bursting with flavor, and crafted with precision. The ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality. I tried the Parmesan Fries and was absolutely blown away it was a symphony of taste.

The service was impeccable. Attentive without being intrusive, the staff made me feel like a VIP from start to finish. They knew the menu inside out and offered perfect recommendations tailored to my tastes.

This place doesn‚Äôt just serve food  it delivers an experience. Whether you're a local or just visiting London, 88 St John Luca is a must-visit. I left not only full, but inspired. Easily one of the best dining experiences I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôll be back soon  and bringing friends."
Luca,5.0,"A great way to celebrate a special occasion, the food goes between good and amazing, the staff is patient, polite and very accommodating.
The tasting menu is good value and the wine list has a good selection and is reasonably priced.
We also received a surprise from the chefs, to celebrate the occasion, thank you!"
Luca,5.0,"We went there for lunch and opted for the bar express menu. Even though it was a Michelin starred restaurant, we went there without any expectation as we were opting for the more ‚Äúquick and budget-friendly‚Äù lunch option. The quality of the food was superb considering the price of the 3-course meal (¬£30). The fried Jerusalem artichoke dish was so flavourful and imo the best dish we had that day. The main was slightly underwhelming considering both the starters were great. Bavette steak was quick chewy but I would assume it‚Äôs due to the choice of cut as meat was cooked to the perfect medium rare temperature as seen in picture. Service was good - the staff were attentive. Overall, it was an enjoyable dining experience  at Luca."
Luca,4.0,The food there is amazing but towards the salty side the atmosphere is relatively good towards the end of the night can be a little bit noisy. There are two dining parts one is close to the bar when it‚Äôs in the main area. I‚Äôd recommend the main area.
Luca,5.0,"This place is immense. Best value for money that I know of in London right now. I had the bar menu tasting menu which was basically three courses for ¬£30. Food this good usually costs a lot more.

Paid extra for bread then had Malfadine pasta and artichokes for starters. Then steak for the main. Followed by pano cotta and tiramisu.

All the dishes were superb. Especially the presentation but the taste was great too. The artichoke glaze was something else.

The steak was rich in flavour and had great texture. It was cooked well and gave many an mmmm moment. The onions were interestingly presented and were a great accompaniment to the meat.

The cocktails and wine were great too.

The food is excellent value. The drinks are on the pricey side bur generally only in relation to the food. Compared to other restaurants of this calibre they‚Äôre totally in line.

Will definitely go again. This place is a hidden gem. Go there before they put the prices up."
Luca,5.0,Hands down the best food in London. Everything was so well presented and tasted out of this world. The service was impeccable to match. We had the pleasure of chatting with Nancy and Christina (I hope I got the spelling right) and they made the experience so memorable. Highly recommended.
Luca,5.0,"Some of the best Italian we‚Äôve had outside of Italy. We shared several different plates with a table of four so got to try several different plates and all of them were done perfectly and with beautiful presentation. Our server Amy was friendly and fun, and super knowledgeable about the menu. Michelin quality food with family feeling service.

Our favorites on the menu were the monkfish crudo, the halibut, and the pasta with rabbit. 6 stars! Would absolutely come back."
Luca,5.0,"Lovely elegant restaurant in a quiet area in Clerkenwell.

Initially it looks like a little quiet bar, but after you pass the bar area towards the back, they have an amazing dinning area. I‚Äôm really impressed with the space and design.

Apart from the tables, they also have 3 rooms which you can reserve for large groups including an outdoor seating section.

The food is delicious and neatly presented, they also serve cocktails and have a lovely selection of wines.

The staff is welcoming and helpful, I was very happy to have finally visited."
Luca,5.0,"Took my mom for an early Mother‚Äôs Day lunch. The restaurant and the staff exceeded my expectations. The service was impeccable, attentive but not excessive. Food was incredible. The atmosphere with soft lighting, very ambient music in the background that allowed to hear each other. Great suggestions from the staff. My mom was made to feel very special. I highly recommend Luca to anyone, for a special occasion or otherwise. I hope to return soon, thank you all so much for giving us such a memorable experience. Best staff! Best food! I will be recommending this to anyone looking for a special venue, great staff and exquisite food."
Luca,5.0,"Best Italian in London! I think Luca has one the best ingredients among London Italian restaurants - the only competition is River Cafe. Just look at the color of the olives, the bean, the pastas. They are all very fresh, and about the best one would find anywhere. We have many favorite Italian restaurants in London. But none of them is comparable in term of ingredients. They maybe good at different format of cooking,  but not ingredients. I‚Äôm very much enjoyed everything we ordered, from bread, olive oil (which is so good that I asked if I can buy some bottles from Luca), scallops, pastas and the dessert.
I also like the vented high ceiling and proper decor. Not over the top, but proper high end Italian setting."
Luca,5.0,"I booked the ‚ÄòPasta Room‚Äô here for my proposal, and had a 7 course Prix Fixe Menu.

Shannon from the bookings team was helpful and always at hand to answer queries and relay messages.

Anastasia was our waitress and the general manager (whose name I‚Äôve sadly forgotten, sorry!) were fantastic throughout the whole evening. Being in a private dining room made the experience so much more intimate, and at no point did we feel like we were forgotten or lacking service.

The food was stunning. I‚Äôd go back in a heartbeat."
Luca,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. We got the lunch express menu, and each course was well-thought out and delicious. Even the bread we got at a starter felt unique and tasted amazing. My trout was very tender and the warm tartar sauce was tangy and paired well with the fish. The portions were good size and I felt full afterwards. The pannacotta dessert was a little too sour but the tiramisu was perfect."
Luca,5.0,Absolutely amazing meal. Incredible food and great staff. Highly recommend sitting outside for great ambiance. Taglierini of Cornish lobster dish was divine. Also recommend the ribeye. Only little disappointment was the lamb - very expensive for the serving size and nothing exceptional. But would definitely go back!!
Luca,5.0,I dined at the bar and had a great experience. The staff were lovely and shout out to the two women running front of house who were attentive and kind! Highly recommend the Parmesan fries and the ravioli. Wish I had room for dessert!
Luca,4.0,"The food is great and the atmosphere is really nice. We got the chef menu, the fish crudo, the burrata and the tortellini were our favourite. The pork was delicious but I think by the time we got to the pork we were already really full, and then followed by a really heavy chocolate dessert. I think in terms of menu logic, it would‚Äôve been smarter to finish off with something lighter or more acidic to cut off the fattiness of the pork. We had a great night, but this meal definitely felt overpriced, the ingredients are fresh and probably seasonal but with that price we expected a bit more expensive ingredients."
Luca,5.0,"The atmosphere of the restaurant was amazing. We had a quick drink at the waiting area and then we moved to the dinning room. The waiters were very friendly and professional. We were impressed by the food and the portions were sufficient.

We would recommend this restaurant, especially for a special occasion!!!"
Luca,3.0,"The spacious, soft inviting glow interior of Luca exudes stylish, subtle elegance that's far removed from stuffy formality ‚Äî setting the backdrop for an enjoyable meal. It‚Äôs the kind of spot where you can linger over your food and conversation without feeling rushed. Service was on point, the staff knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing, ensuring dishes arrived at an ideal pace with the exception of the bill.

The evening began with a familiar opening act: bread and olive oil. The bread, still faintly warm from the oven, featured a crusty exterior and a pillowy interior, practically begging to be dipped into the olive oil. A simple combination to start. The parmesan fries were just delightful. Golden, crispy, and generously dusted with parmesan. They danced dangerously between churro and cheesy indulgence. A truly addictive starter.

The monkfish crudo, however, was a misstep. The combination of flavors didn‚Äôt quite gel, and the monkfish's texture was slightly rubbery, lacking the succulence expected in a crudo. The salad of italian and british seasonal leaves was refreshingly simple yet satisfying, highlighted by fresh and high-quality greens.

The rigatoni with pork sausage rag√π was a bolder affair. The pasta was cooked al dente, though I did find the ragu to pasta ratio a bit off. Some strands of rigatoni were ragu-less, while others were swimming in it. Nevertheless, the rag√π itself was flavorful with a precise balance of meat, tomato, and spice.

Then came the off-menu truffle tagliolini cacio e pepe. The moment the waiter uttered ""truffle,"" I was sold and I couldn‚Äôt resist. The pasta was cooked to perfection, the cacio rich and creamy, and the truffle shavings truly generous. It transported me straight to the upper echelon of the pasta world.

While Luca offers many delights and is undoubtedly a destination for pasta lovers, it's not without a few minor hiccups. But when a dish hits the mark, it truly resonates- you just need to find them."
Luca,5.0,"It's been such a long time since I have had dinner at 9pm. (only booking we could get last moment in the weeks leading up to Christmas.)

Now to the important part, OMG this place is amazing. I'm not a high end foodie so I may not be able to do this place justice in terms of description.
But the food is amazing, the variety, the tastes, the quality - it all matched up to be a beautiful meal. (silly way to explain how good it was but food made with love.)"
Luca,5.0,"Such an amazing restaurant, traditional Italian comfort food but make it classy. Went with a couple of friend and we got seated in a very lovely location. The bread was stunning, and the wine selection really good too!"
Luca,5.0,"Lunch here was great - we started of with the potato sourdough from the dusty knuckle paired with some Sicilian olive oil. Parmesan fries were a lovely starter paired with some wine. These were Parmesan fries that were piped into the fryer (if that makes sense). Starters: sea bass crudo and burrata, which was both extremely refreshing for a spring day. We had the cacio e pepe cappelletti with white asparagus & morels and mezzi paccheri with pork ragu and a hint of mint, both were delicious. Then shared a Scottish halibut at the end, which we thought was a generous portion of fish and also perfectly cooked. Lemon tart and fennel ice cream was also a great choice to end the meal. Big shout out to Yda, who gave us recommendations, greeted us with a lovely smile and her cheerful attitude for the whole afternoon."
Luca,4.0,"The place is really nice. The food was a mixed bag. The nduja scallops were divine but the truffle ravioli, mushroom pasta, and tiramisu were just ok. The ravioli dish was quite sweet for my taste and felt very overpriced for ¬£48."
Luca,3.0,"My friend recommended we come here due to the good reviews, as we thought we'd have a go!
We had the veggie set menu and everything was delicious, but seemed incredibly expensive compared to other (better) restaurants I've been to. If you've got money to burn, please go. If you don't, there are much better restaurants for similar/cheaper.
The staff were super friendly as well, explained everything and you felt as though you could ask them anything."
Luca,5.0,"Luca
a phenomenal restaurant from start to finish.
it is rare that I ever give 5 stars to a restaurant. it is even rare I give 4 stars.
in this case, it is an easy 5.

I‚Äôll start with the decor, the place is simply stunning, giving you a feeling of a high end restaurant in Sicily.
Staff were exceptional. very attentive and knowledgeable. excellent wine selection and a phenomenal sommelier (who‚Äôs also the GM and looked after us the whole evening) - Stephan.

we were 2 and ordered 9 dishes and 5 desserts. ofc, all staff members were shocked. but we‚Äôve had to try. we don‚Äôt go east often. plus, this is how we roll.

I‚Äôll start with the phenomenal bread which is made by a separate bakery and it is simply phenomenal. accommodating throughout the whole meal, as you dip the bread and the mouthwatering genius sauces.
their Sicilian olive oil is to die for. how can an olive oil be this exceptional?

the parmesan fries were to die for. such thin batter that melts in your mouth, made me think - how the hell it didn‚Äôt break frying it!
the Monk fish starter was probably one of the best dishes of the night. so as the burrata with the fig, beetroot and hazelnut. both dishes had multiple textures and flavors accumulating throughout. seconds after you took the bite.
the scallops were boring and I‚Äôd avoid ordering.

we‚Äôve had 3 pastas, the Rabbit Tagliatelle was good but missing salt.
the Cappelletti and Tortelli were both amazing. empowering and full of flavor.

The lamb was made to perfection but had too many things on the plate. so I‚Äôd simply would of had just the lamb with the goats curd and would of found the dish perfect. everything else took away for the perfectly cooked meat.
the halibot was great but nothing exceptional.

all 5 desserts were amazing. very light and simply accurate.

I would avoid the mains and focus on the Anti Pasti, Primi and desserts."
Luca,5.0,"Me and my sister had an amazing lunch at Luca, celebrating our birthdays! We had the chef‚Äôs menu of 2 antipasto to share, primo, secondo e dolce. It was all amazing, especially bucatini and tiramisu. Very fast and smart service. I absolutely recommend this location. Thank you!!"
Luca,5.0,"This restaurant is up there with the best in London in my opinion. The food is delicious (favourites included the John Dory and the Stone Bass) but the team are also both on-point and so friendly. We sat at / enjoyed the counter but the other three areas (kitchen area; ‚Äúmain‚Äù room, outside space) all looked great. Special shoutout to Alessandro and the bartenders, Will and Cashel - thank you for making our evening so special."
Luca,5.0,"Really lovely restaurant about 20 min walk from Liverpool Street. Very unassuming from the outside but opens up when you walk through. Very good service. Not sure if they have a sommelier, no one offered to talk us through the wine list or make recommendations. I had a cocktail which was tasty and well made . Water was continually topped up including sparkling water. We opted for the chefs menu, so the chef chooses the food they serve you. The catered for different allergens . The different waiters did say what the food was but was very quietly spoken so did not always hear. Our main server was very attentive and kind. The napkins were very fluffy and left white bobbles on both mine and my husbands trousers that did not brush off easy. Overall very tasty food especially the parmesan fries and a very good service."
Luca,3.0,"For a restaurant bearing a Michelin star, the experience left much to be desired. The evening was marred by a pervasive sense of being hurried, an unfortunate distraction.

The service, while polite, lacked finesse. From the moment we were seated, there was a noticeable rush: plates were cleared before we‚Äôd finished, mains arrived prematurely, and even our request for a few minutes to discuss the wine was interrupted by an eager inquiry for our food order. Feedback offered to the staff was met not with reflection, but rather with ‚Äúthe pasta must be eaten hot‚Äù, a response that, while technically correct, misses the larger point about guest experience.

Among the mains, the pistachio tortellini was the standout. In contrast, the rigatoni with pork sausage rag√π was forgettable, lacking depth - in my opinion any household in Italy would have done it better.

The highlight of the evening, without question, was the wine. The sommelier was very gracious too.

At this price point, we definitely expected more. Sadly, this visit failed to deliver."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Speedboat Bar has nailed the basics - a concise one pager menu and food with fresh and bold flavours. I only ordered the Tom Yam Mama Noodles as a main and it was fantastic. The right amount of heat and depth of flavour until the last spoonful. Pork was crispy on the outside and tender. I also tried the crispy chicken skins. They were indeed very crispy and flavourful, making you want more. The pineapple pie with taro ice-cream was a fantastic end, crispy pastry and caramelised pineapple inside."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"We visited the Speedboat Bar and really enjoyed the experience. The atmosphere felt very authentic, both in terms of the food and the interior design. The service was friendly and welcoming, which added to the overall positive impression. We sat upstairs, which was a nice spot, though it was quite loud and made conversation a bit difficult. The menu offered good options, but the selection for vegetarians was somewhat limited. One thing to note: the Pad Krapao was extremely spicy ‚Äî so be prepared if you order it! Overall, a great place with authentic vibes and tasty food ‚Äì just be prepared for a lively, noisy setting."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Food and drinks were great!! I am obsessed with Tom yum mama noodles and regularly have the instant version at home so this boujee version was fantastic!! The fried rice was very flavoursome and even better with the sauces! Pour the beef tongue curry sauce on it and it‚Äôs even better! The pineapple pie was a nice way to end the meal
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"The place looks like old bangkok which is lovely. The staff were friendly and attentive. I had the most awesome time eating, i think they have the best tom yum mama in town, it‚Äôs so rich and filling. Id definitely go back :)"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Food all overpriced and small portions
Ridiculous small size tom yum mama noodle price ¬£29 but it is just taste same as Thai brand mama instant noodles which you can buy around ¬£1.....the crispy pork in it is not crispy and meat is dry.   Morning glory is excellent, salad taste authentic. The invoice said there is OPTIONAL donation and OPTIONAL 13.5% service charge, but I dont see there is any option. Overall not nice experience."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"I had a great Sunday lunch here! The food was outstanding, bursting with authentic flavors.

The decor is fantastic‚Äîit really transported me to a local restaurant in Thailand. Upstairs, the bar has a cool retro vibe that I absolutely loved.

The food leans on the saltier side, but I didn‚Äôt mind since I paired it with their delicious green tea‚Äîsweet, milky, and just right. My only complaint is the price; they charge ¬£6 for the tea, which, with service charges, could probably get me ten of them in Thailand.

For starters, we had the pork belly‚Äîcrispy and packed with flavor‚Äîalong with a chicken salad that was tangy and had a fun crunch from the crispy bits. The fried rice was well-seasoned and far beyond your average dish. The beef tongue curry was tasty but a little too oily for my liking. Still, everything was incredibly satisfying!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"One of the most unique Thai restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to. The food was super flavorful, a bit spicy but not unbearable and really well rounded. The tongue and tendon curry is what I had and it was amazing! Very tasty crispy pork as a snack, the chicken skins also were so tasty. Can‚Äôt forget to mention the sweet corn fritters which amazingly well with an ice cold draft Singha. Can‚Äôt forget to mention the margarita which was super unique and unlike any cocktail I‚Äôve ever had. Little bit spicy, not too sweet, not too sour and a good dosage of booze ;). Would recommend!!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Had to see what the hype was about and honestly I think it‚Äôs worth it!! Really amazing flavours and authentic to Thai roots. It‚Äôs London pricing of course so I‚Äôve seen some folks upset by the portion size for price, and I think that‚Äôs a valid criticism.

We had crispy pork to start, super delicious, melts in your mouth and the spicy sauce that comes on the side was awesome.

We also tried cellophane noodles with chicken, beef noodles and fried rice. Everything was spectacular flavour wise so I‚Äôd gladly go back!

It‚Äôs a small place so highly recommend making a reservation."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Really good food and friendly service. We ordered the chicken skins, corn fritters, fried rice and beef tongue and tendon curry. All were delicious and authentic. The atmosphere of this restaurant was great and almost like being transported to Thailand."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,More flash than substance. Some dishes were good while others like the cellophane noodles didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark (bland and lacked flavour). Was a bit pricey for what was served. Service was great - friendly and fast. The wine list was small and expensive. The cava was full of sediment and wasn‚Äôt great; you‚Äôre better off ordering wine or beer with your meal.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"One of those places that you stumble on and turns out to be absolutely fantastic.

The service was top notch, fast and efficient.

The Tom Yum noodles with crispy pork, prawns & squid is the best I‚Äôve ever tasted.

By far the best food I‚Äôve had this year."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Food was very yummy and hit the spot. We had a curry, fried fish, rice and crispy pork and it was the perfect amount for two people. The food was a bit overpriced but that‚Äôs London. Atmosphere was great but we came at 3 and it wasn‚Äôt very busy so I understand it may change when it hits 7"
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"I don‚Äôt really understand why this restaurant has such high ratings, the food is average, nothing particular amazing despite we ordered their most popular dishes. They are definitely overpriced for the portion.

The minced beef with holy basil was way too salty and overpowered the actual flavour of the ingredients, portion quite small and have to order rice separately.

Tom Yam noodles dish was very picturesque but it tasted exactly like the instant mama noodles shrimp flavour, except creamier and more sour. The exact same noodles as the instant noodles, given the price I felt ripped off. However I enjoyed the chunky pork bellies, prawns and meat balls, egg yolk, the toppings were my favourite. The ingredients don‚Äôt blend together though, felt like each ingredient was cooked separately. Using instant noodles in a dish is a big no for me, tasted too much like instant noodles I have all the time."
Speedboat Bar,1.0,"I had a poor experience at Speedboat Bar and would not recommend it. Despite the buzz around this venue, my visit left much to be desired in terms of food quality, service, and overall ambience.

Venue & Atmosphere:
The interior attempts to echo the feel of a lower-end Thai eatery, with dated d√©cor including a worn carpeted staircase and nostalgic photos of Thai street food stalls and the Thai monarchy. There are about 16 tables inside, with a few more outside and upstairs. The upstairs section has more seating, a bar, a pool table, and two unisex toilets. Tables are crammed closely together, and the lack of sound insulation means you‚Äôre clearly overhearing conversations from adjacent tables. The ambience is chaotic and uncomfortable‚Äîparticularly awkward as diners have to shift around when others leave due to space constraints. Best suited for a group of 4; smaller tables are impractical.

Drinks:
A decent selection of Thai beers like Singha and Leo, alongside some interesting cocktails and Thai iced coffee/tea. This was probably the highlight of the visit.

Food (Tasting Menu): Yaowarat Road Set Menu (¬£36pp)
Unfortunately, the food was a letdown across the board:
‚Ä¢ Chicken skin with Zaep seasoning: Overwhelmingly salty and spicy, with what tasted like a heavy dose of MSG. The skin was tough and the meat quality poor.
‚Ä¢ Chicken match with green mango: Unbalanced‚Äîcloyingly sweet and overly sour. The tamarind was overpowering.
‚Ä¢ Sweetcorn fritters: Extremely average and forgettable.
‚Ä¢ Stir-fried morning glory: Again, just average‚Äînothing stood out.
‚Ä¢ Minced beef with basil: Poor quality meat in an overpowering sauce.
‚Ä¢ Crispy pork curry: This dish had a vaguely sweet rendang-like sauce but was let down by fatty, low-quality pork belly. It was hard to find much actual meat.Large amounts were wasted due to the large amounts of  meat fat.

Value for Money:
The tasting menu came to ¬£72, but when pricing up the individual dishes, it amounted to about ¬£63. This wouldn‚Äôt have mattered if the food quality had been good‚Äîbut given the lack of balance in flavour, poor quality meat, no dessert included, and overall disappointing experience, it felt like poor value.

Service:
Service was indifferent. Dishes were dropped at the table without explanation, and staff seemed disengaged. When we raised concerns about the inedible chicken skin, we were told nothing could be substituted as it was a set menu. The manager simply reiterated this, showing no flexibility or empathy. There was no effort to remedy the situation.

Overall:
Below-average ambience, poor service, and subpar food with questionable meat quality and unbalanced flavours. Disappointing on almost every front. I‚Äôd advise avoiding this spot if you‚Äôre after a pleasant Thai dining experience in London."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Great food, staff were friendly and service was fast. Upstairs is mainly for drinks and has a pool table. Not sure if you have to pay to play, didn‚Äôt ask üôÇ
Anyways food was the most amazing Thai food. The shrimp ceviche was spicy and to die for."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Very tasty Thai food. Not a big menu, so you may not have a lot of choice though. I had a vegetarian curry and it was delicious. Very popular so reservation is advised."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Setup is authentic, gives you the Thai street food feel for sure but at a 10x higher price tag. Had their specialty tomyam noodle soup with pork, prawn, squid and meatballs which was very nice but definitely not worth ¬£29. Every one of their dishes essentially contain the same crispy pork belly, but just a variation of it.
Cocktail are OK and so was the service."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Good Thai and Asian dishes that you don't usually get elsewhere. The pineapple pie is to die for.

The bill became quite steep at lunch simply for 2, as portion sizes are quite small. The fried morning glory doesn't quite hit the spot and feels like it's missing a bit of seasoning - understandable though as they're catering for western palates.

Would definitely come back another time to try the beer tower!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Food tasted better than expected. Excellent taste! The staff were helpful and friendly.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Speedboat Bar, how much did I love thee? It was so good I came back twice on the same night. While London is so much better for foodies, the Asian flavours are still somewhat toned down and a little bland in several places. After a week in town, I was craving flavours that are more assertive and true to SE Asian cuisines and this place delivered in spades. My mouth was so happy!! The restaurant doesn‚Äôt have a spiciness scale so if you can‚Äôt handle lots of garlic and chilies, you may want to read the descriptions more carefully or ask the staff which dishes are less spicy.

All photos are dishes I ate in the restaurant - pork belly and prawn ceviche (first trip) and the sausage and mustard greens (second trip). Dishes I ordered to go are the phad see ew (which sadly I had to let go since I couldn‚Äôt keep it while watching a show even though I‚Äôm not planning on eating it) and the naem fried rice, which I ordered to go the second time I came back. Tip: If you get the mustard greens and the naem fried rice, pour the leftover sauce from the pickled greens on top of the fried rice. You‚Äôre welcome!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"SUCH a Cool place and great quality and authentic Thai food, decor transports you back to the 90s in Thailand. There‚Äôs free pool upstairs, it‚Äôs a whole vibe. The prawn ceviche was amazing (but on the spicier side) and the salted duck egg + anchovy option was wild but didn‚Äôt regret it! also got the Tom yum which is more pricey but could be shared between 2 people and highly recommend but it was the star of the show. Like wow. Cocktails and other drinks are delicious and decent options but maybe they could do a creamy pina colada option to cool my mouth after all those spices! But the ice tea did the trick x"
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Very authentic, Thai experience in Central London.
Food was good but I guess it could have been a bit better. A bit too greasy for me.
I recommend sitting upstairs as the vibe is a bit better but overall entire place has nice, thai decor."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We were staying very close to this restaurant and were looking forward to dine here. The reservation seemed excessive but didn't want to take a chance. The restaurant itself is worth the hype. You are transported to Thailand food streets and in the most wonderful way. We tried a bunch of things and everything was top notch. Our favorite were the naemh fried rice, ooh delicious and the flat noodles, banging! Highly recommend to anyone in London looking for great food ."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"I was quite excited to try Speedboat Bar because of the positive reviews. The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty basic, service is okay nothing exceptional yet there is 13.5% service charge. The food is delicious, however the portions are so small for the amount of money you pay and it is safe to say you can leave the restaurant still feeling hungry. The experience overall felt like a rip off. What I found frustrating as well is that nowhere in the menu they have specified how spicy each dish is and you may end up ordering something that you cannot eat just because of how hot it is."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"At the time of writing, this is probably the best Thai food that I have had in London. The restaurant itself does feel like you could be in Bangkok, down to the Muay Thai fights being shown on the televisions. The food was all excellent, perfectly balanced between spicy, sweet and sour. We tried the chicken skins (something I am amazed has not become more popular in the UK), crispy pork, mustard greens with Chinese sausage (which was maybe a rogue choice but may have been my favourite dish), beef tongue curry, pad krapao (with a fried egg, of course), and morning glory. Will definitely be back."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Just one of the very best thai meals I had in London. Hands down.
Went with my missus for our anniversary and we were mesmerized. Can‚Äôt recommend this enough. Honest prices and great service as well, can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"We were asked if we were done 3 times by the staff whilst staying there for about an hour. Visibly we had food left on the plates and were still eating. There were 3 empty tables around us. I got the impression that they wanted us to leave quickly.
Had Tom yum, chicken with green mango kerabu, Tom yum noodles and fried fish fillet. Chicken and fish were both really salty and needed hefty rice to eat with, but generally flavourful."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Love Plaza Khao Gaeng so when I heard this place was run by the same people I had to visit.

Fantastic! Everything we ordered was bursting with flavor. Highly recommend coming here if you like Thai food."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Amazing! One of the best Thai places I‚Äôve been in London. Every dish was so tasty. If you‚Äôre not afraid of some offal I highly recommend the beef tongue and tendons, super fatty and delicious. The crispy chicken skins are also a must to start!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Food was fantastic, incredibly tasty. The atmosphere made you feel like you were right in the heart of Bangkok. I would highly recommend a visit."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Speed Boat Bar, Chinatown London
I've got high hopes and am really looking forward to this place! There are a lot of choices around Chinatown, but I wanted to give it a try!
They were fully booked and seemed very popular but, given my name on the waiting list, it took 30 mins as they turned table very quickly. It has great vibes in the seating area downstairs. It's a complex menu and reasonably priced if compared in London. We didn't drink alcohol but tried Thai Tea, which was okay. They looked nice but nothing special. The food was good, but some of the dishes had too much spice and way too salty! I didn't like the pork snack at all. The taste was weird (it is much better without the sour taste!!) Tomyum noodles in the hotpot (¬£29) looked fantastic but a little too much spice in them! But the ingredients were top quality! The bill was ¬£100 which is usually the price of 2 anyway. Very good and friendly service. Hopefully I will be back for cocktails and shots with Minced Beef With Holy Basil and rice. Check it out if you're in this area! Thank you."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,A very authentic Thai experience here in London. The waitress was amazing and we really did enjoy our food which was a tounge curry(pretty spicy) and a fried rice. Would eat here again when back in London.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Lives up to the hype. Incredible food, we loved everything we ate. To balance the spice get the Jelly Bia cocktail (it was surprisingly so tasty!) we dangerously could‚Äôve eat an entire bag of the crispy chicken skins lol. We loved the Tom Yum soup w squid prawns and giant slices of crispy pork belly. YUM!"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Food: The food was tasty, but we were a bit disappointed with the small portion sizes.

Service: The staff were friendly, but there wasn‚Äôt much service beyond taking our order and bringing water/bill. They didn‚Äôt come to check if the food was okay etc.

Price: Considering the small portions and minimal service, we found the prices to be quite overpriced. On top of that, a 13.5% service charge was added to the bill (higher than the normal 12.5% service charge in London), along with a ¬£1 charity donation‚Äîsomething we hadn‚Äôt encountered before in London and elsewhere.

Atmosphere: The decor is very Thai-inspired, and the space appears to have been converted from an English pub. There‚Äôs even a pool table upstairs, which is quite interesting. Most of the customers were Westerners; we barely saw any East Asian diners - the above probably explains why."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"Having lived in Thailand for around 20 years, we were very disappointed in the food.

It wasn‚Äôt bad, but it really didn‚Äôt taste authentic. The flavours were just not right.

Find it hard to believe that it was made by Thai people.

Service was professional and friendly."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Service was good and efficient however I wasn‚Äôt blown away from the food. We ordered chicken skins however they were very spicy to the point it ruined our mains, we weren‚Äôt even informed that they were spicy on the menu. The main courses were just average in my opinion, I did like the pad see ew, the Thai tea that we ordered tasted watery. Overall disappointing and pricey, not really authentically Thai. Would not return."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"The restaurant offers pretty typical Thai food and it tastes good. However, the menu is quite small and the portions are not very big. The wait time for a table is ~10 mins and the average price per head is ¬£26/person without a drink."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Excellent authentic Thai food that doesn't pull its punches when it comes to spice (be warned). The cocktails were very good as well.

My only gripe was that it was quite expensive for what it is - maybe I'm spoiled by my local Thai eatery but this place was almost twice the price (although I suppose there is a Soho premium).

All in all, very worthwhile a visit."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Best Thai place in London. Avoid if you cannot handle your spice as they are not joking. The cocktails are also very nice and the Thai ice tea is a 10/10. Also, make sure to order the Chicken Skin as appetiser."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Service was quick and attentive, and the atmosphere felt relaxed, almost like a casual caf√©. We ordered chicken skin, morning glory, beef tongue curry, crispy pork curry, and a noodle dish. I can‚Äôt say it felt completely authentic, but everything was tasty enough that we finished it all.

I do agree with some of the earlier comments about the food being on the salty side and the portions feeling a little small for the price. Overall, I‚Äôm glad we gave it a try, but I think I‚Äôd lean towards local spots that haven‚Äôt been so heavily reviewed and hyped by London food critics."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"This is my second visit to this restaurant, and I still love the ambiance because it feels just like being in Thailand. They offer beer towers and authentic Thai dishes that are delicious and packed with strong flavors, but the portions are quite small for the price. It‚Äôs on the expensive side, but it‚Äôs fine for occasional visits. I recommend it if you‚Äôre looking for an authentic Thai food."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Thought this was 'good' but not 'great'. Good: because the food was generally tasty, reasonable value, good atmosphere. But missed out on being 'great' as a lot of the dishes were fairly simple and not massively innovative - e.g. minced beef with spices and a fried egg. I thought the fried chicken skins, which people rave about, just tasted like pork scratchings.

The cocktails were great though, other than the negroni which wasn't especially different to a normal negroni.

I see a lot of reviews worry about levels of spice. I thought it was fine (as a Brit!) although the curry was definitely at the upper end of my tolerance level.

Unusually I thought the dessert was the best course and I would definitely recommend the taro ice cream option."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,I recently visited with a partner the restaurant for a dinner. I booked a table ahead of time as tables go quickly. A big downside for me was the layout of the tables where basically you are sharing your table with some strangers ( who actually came in sick). All of the dishes were tasty however I found that some of the dishes had too much of spice. It would be great if the menu adopted a scale of spiciness. The biggest highlight of this restaurant is the superb dessert with taro ice cream. I will surely return here only to enjoy that delicious dessert!
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Most impressive crispy pork ever‚Ä¶!! It is first slow cooked then the skin is made crispy‚Ä¶ fine dining level of preparation. Crispy skin with melt-in-your-mouth experience.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Really enjoyed it. My third time here and London heatwave made me think I could almost be in Thailand! Service was good and friendly. Food was good although I thought the beef stir-fry was quite salty (and I like my salt) and the fish over cooked. I know it was deep fried but wonder whether it was reheated - it was very crunchy. The aubergine was my favourite and I really liked the prawn 'ceviche'. Will definitely return. Love the atmosphere and spice levels!
Speedboat Bar,1.0,"We had:
Beef tongue curry: not much flavour other than a tinge of curry taste, one-dimensional taste and nothing interesting about it, meat was 60% fats
Morning glory: super sweet and salty
Crispy pork: perhaps the only saving grace but still pretty average
Crispy chicken skin: very salty
Rice: dry

Portions were very small, food came very cold and we waited more than 30ish mins for the food. Appreciate the staff who found us a table despite visiting with no reservation. Atmosphere was not that bad, interesting deco but we were seated on the same table as the couple who were constantly making out lol. Hence, overall a very unpleasant and disturbing experience for us."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Amazing varied dishes with a good kick to them! Place is packed and you can see why! gluten free options are available but not all dishes
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Loved the food here, specially the tom yum but also the place is designed and curated to perfection to remind you of a local Bangkok bar - great lighting, attention to all details, every corner will remind you of Bangkok"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"everything we ordered was amazing! The restaurant was full of people, it was a fun, loose atmosphere, we really enjoyed ut and would absolutely visit again!"
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"Overhyped restaurant which I‚Äôm unsure how it‚Äôs sustaining its rating.

We tried the ‚Äúset menu‚Äù which was shockingly bad. The chicken skins, as others mentioned, were served cold and can easily chip a tooth. Out of the food that comes with the set menu 3/5 are intensely spicy with no ability of the restaurant to module the heat. We ordered a Tom Yam on the side which was one of the only things we could eat‚Ä¶

Cocktails were average, service was average, and overall not value for money if you look at the price tag. I would not recommend this restaurant."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"An amazing find. I realize its a popular place. Went there with friends and tried a whole variety of dishes. Every dish was special and tasted amazing. Highly recommend going there.
For a fun citrus drink, definitely try the calamansi drink."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Enjoyed the food, but the portion sizes didn‚Äôt quite justify the price."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Service is nothing short of incredible.   We arrived an hour early and took a chance to ask if we could move our slot in which they obliged without issue. Most restaurants tend to rush you with ordering and getting out, not here, the waitress took time to help choose and explain the cocktails and suggestions on food.
Fish balls, chicken skins and the noodles were absolutely amazing and will be back for those again.
I do love a good holy basil stir fry, and would say this was the only dish that was a slight let down on taste.  Other than that 10/10."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"I was surprised that all the dishes were smaller than I expected.
In the country where I live, I‚Äôve never seen such small portions at a restaurant"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We absolutely loved the food here. There are lots of vegan options, just make sure you ask for the vegetarian menu when you arrive!

The pickled mustard green salad, sweet corn fritters and potato and gourd curry are not to be missed. A great combo together.

Yum!

Portion size is not huge.

Atmosphere is cool, trying to be authentic."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"The chicken matches & mango and the pickled mustard greens salad are very delicious! I liked the corn fritters, the minced meat, and the potato curry. The tendon curry and the aubergine were a bit bland for my taste. All the dishes go well together and it is definitely a memorable meal. Lovely music and a fun atmosphere and the service is very friendly. But make sure you ask for the vegetarian menu because even though we expressed interest in trying different dishes that didn‚Äôt have pork, we weren‚Äôt told that we could have some of the dishes without it (such as the pickled mustard greens) until we‚Äôve ordered most of our food and even then we weren‚Äôt given a vegetarian menu to look at. So I would recommend you ask for both menus before placing your order. All in all, I would highly recommend this place!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We came to Speedboat Bar on a whim quite early‚Äîaround 5 pm‚Äîand managed to get a seat. The decor is styled like a fast-food bar in Bangkok, and while the colourful and slightly tacky-looking menu and design may seem basic at first glance, they are, in fact, well crafted in that style (if you have a design eye!). The menu feels authentic (to a Brit like me who's only visited Bangkok once!) and refreshingly different from what you might expect at typical Thai restaurants in London (don't expect a Green Curry on the menu!). That‚Äôs what makes it special‚Äîeverything feels both interesting and familiar. We ordered a variety of dishes, as you can see, ranging from fried rice to beef noodles and crispy pork. Every dish was fantastic, with a great balance of spice and flavour‚Äîsome of the best Thai food I‚Äôve had in London with the flavour. The prices are expected for the central location, and the portion sizes are good. The beer selection is pretty much all Singha brand, which are typically pretty light later pairs well with the food. Drinks are available by the bottle, half pint, or tower, alongside some interesting cocktails - although they didn't have the Negroni available. Visit Speedboat Bar if you‚Äôre after fantastic food in a fun, unpretentious setting."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Yummy food! But not life changing. More like a 4.5 but Google doesn‚Äôt support that.

The steamed aubergine was actually our favourite. The beef tongue curry was a little chewy, but I enjoyed the tendons! Our fried eggs were cold which was sad. The sweetcorn fritters were good but not life changing. Some were a bit expensive

Really enjoyed the taro ice cream, although the pineapple pie was okay

Overall think I enjoyed plaza khao gheng for food a little more.
Service was really lovely!
Tables were pretty squished"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Finally got to try this place after all the hype and recommendations. I have to say, the food options (way more interesting and exciting than your average high street Thai restaurant or takeaway) were varied and modern and the quality was superb. I'll be coming back with some friends in the near future.

The morning glory was the best I've had outside of Thailand and the black pepper sea bream was original and so tasty. Everything did have a spicy kick to it, but it made it authentic! The restaurant has a cool vibe and feels a bit like being in Thailand with the cutlery they use, the stainless steel tables, the pictures of the Royal Family on the walls etc. I'd say it's definitely a casual atmosphere and more of a cafe vibe than restaurant, which is why it feels authentically Thai.

Service from our main waitress was very good, she was friendly and polite. They also let us add one extra person to the booking on arrival.... which was much appreciated.

My only negative comment is the portion sizes! Some of them are so small we had to order double after tucking into our mains. I guess that is why the quality is so good as they are tight with the dish sizes...

Bill came to ¬£117 including service for 3 adults for lunch, without alcohol or starters. Just loads of mains and sides."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,We were recommended this Thai place during our last visit to London and thought we must try. Note you need to make a reservation well in advance. I made mine 3 weeks in advanced just to be sure. I think the outdoor seating is first come first serve however but that‚Äôs risky in London when it can rain all of a sudden. The staff are very friendly and explained the whole menu to us. I just wish they were a bit more honest on the spiciness of the food. We ordered some of the curries and were told that it was mild. They were very spicy and quite uncomfortable to eat. Other than the spice though they were delicious and tasted very authentic and similar to food I had when visiting Thailand a couple of years ago. I highly recommend to anyone who loved Thai and can handle spicy food. I‚Äôd avoid the alcoholic cocktails as they were quite watered down and not the greatest. Best to stick with a nice Thai beer or water! Enjoy!
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"An absolute surprise to find such amazing tasting Thai food in a ""Bar""

Highly recommend this place for Thai food but he warned the spice levels are high.

The aubergine was delicious and so was the prawn ceviche.

Don't forget to order the corn fritters for starters and the rice noodles with prawn and the beans ü•∞"
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Got a table for lunch on a rainy Sunday afternoon without a reservation- be warned it is a busy popular place and we have failed to eat here before sans reservation.
Great food and atmosphere. Quirky uniforms for the servers. Service is quick, friendly and efficient.
We shared the absolutely delicious chicken matches with green mango kerabu. And will order it again. The portion looks small but it packs a punch and can easily be shared by 2 if you are ordering more food. The crispy egg noodles, gravy, pork , prawns and squid was underwhelming- the gravy was not ‚ÄòThai‚Äô enough- almost western, dare I say and we were probably expecting something tangy and exciting. Still, we asked for and got some birds eye chilli which definitely made an improvement. Crispy pork and black pepper with a rice side lived up to expectations. The food was delicious and different from anything one usually gets in a Thai restaurant. Giving it a 4 * only because the noodles did not live up to our expectations. But will be back to try other things in the menu."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Second visit and reminded us of why we couldn't wait to come back. All of the dishes are so tasty and packed full of flavours.
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Wasn't too bad for a first visit. No frills and you will come out smelling of the kitchen goodness you were steeped in hehe. We were sat downstairs in the main restaurant in a cosy corner. We had a milk tea and a cocktail with the sweetcorn fritters to get going and they were OK. Cocktail felt watered down though - can't remember the name but it had guava in it which is why I chose it. Sweetcorn fritters a touch oily but not off-puttingly so. Mains were the special Maggie mee pot and we also had the whole dry curry sea bream. These were fair. Not crazy delicious, i have to say but filled a gap. The instant noodles dish (i say as an asian who loves instant noodles lol) was big and I struggled to finish it actually possibly due to the tom yum soup being the creamy one rather than the lighter broth one. Taro ice cream was nice as was the pineapple tart it came with.

FYI The bathrooms are upstairs and there are only two unisex to use which you will definitely need to really push the doors hard to check if they are in use otherwise you will be politely waiting for ages lol the restaurant should do something to make it easier or more visible to see whether they are in use or not. It was mentioned our booking was for a birthday, but there was no acknowledgement of this so I wonder what's the point of having this feature in the booking process."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"An overhyped restaurant that is overpriced with average food, average service and average decor. You‚Äôd go once and never return.

The chicken skins were small portion and shockingly cold when they arrived. I asked and they told me, it was cooked previously and served cold. So I sent it back. Cold chicken skin - unbelievable.

The corn fritters were hot and freshly made but bland. Good portion but the chilli sauce was straight from a bottle. Not worth ¬£8.

The glass noodles (vermicelli) were nice but tiny portion with so little chicken. Not worth the ¬£14 price.

Half a pint of Singha was quite pricey.

Toilet was shocking and seat was broken.

Don‚Äôt believe the hype. Avoid"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"First of all, the service is slow. Food is great for most dishes, we recommend crispy pork and the fish fillet.
The mama noodle was a disaster, it‚Äôs something that we can definitely make at home with few simple ingredients, and the dish was 30 üí∑, and it wasn‚Äôt even good lol.

The worst part if the bill, they included donation money which we had no clue about. I found out when looking at the bills and did request to took it off.
Would we go back? No
Do we recommend? No"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"The flavour is fabulous! Not too salty or sweet, it's just right! The fish is perfectly fried and the curry is creamy. My friend like the corn fritters a lot. I like the fish! The rest are nice too. I will definitely be back! Please make a reservation! Always full!

Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Very tasty authentic Thai food! I needed a place for lunch before going to the show Les Miserables and found this Thai place so I walked in with no booking.
I  had some Pad See Ew beef and a whiskey ice for lunch. The fried noodles tasted super good and the beef was very tender! I love my meal but I think it's slightly small in portion for the price.
The staff was friendly!"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Unfortunately I'm updating my review and downgrading it to a 2 out of 5. The Tom Yum that had impressed me so much on my previous visit was disappointing. The balance was not ok and it was extremely sour (of course it needs to be sour but this was too much. It was not pleasant to eat). The egg yolk did not turn the broth into the silky one I remembered. Service was also not great. It took ages to get the order and to get the bill. Such a disappointment. I used to adore this place.

Old review
No doubt that this was the best Thai food I've ever had outside of Thailand. Every single dish was absolutely delicious. They all had different levels of heat but in no case the heat covered any of the other flavours. My mouth and lips were tingling when I left the place. The best dish by miles was the Tom Yum soup. Completely different to any other Tom Yum I've ever had before. The creaminess that the egg yolk added completely changed the broth. It was scrumptious. Can't wait to go back again"
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"We really enjoyed the food. The crispy pork curry was delicious and had just the right amount of heat and the Naem fried rice was one of the best fried rice I‚Äôve ever had - just such great wok flavours. Sadly, the service didn‚Äôt match the food. We started off with a Chinese girl who was very pleasant and friendly but then there seemed to be a change of shift and she disappeared and a couple of young guys started serving our table. The service was very robotic or like a couple of students who had just been told what to do with no attempt to connect with the customer. Or perhaps it‚Äôs the 12.5% service charge and they don‚Äôt care as they know they will get some tips.
They also charged us 50p for some extra fish sauce. I‚Äôd understand if it was a home-made sauce but it comes from a mass-produced bottle and is probably something that most customers don‚Äôt touch and gets thrown away all the time.
Great food but improve the service and this place is a 5 star."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"A really cool themed Thai restaurant!! The inside of the restaurant was decorated in a very interesting way, it gave the place a great atmosphere and a relaxing feeling. The service was good nothing to complain about.
We loved the cool names and dishes on both the drinks and food menu. The only thing I would definitely say to watch out for is the spicy warnings on the menu, they are incredibly hot and not for the faint hearted."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Great food, great drinks and friendly staff. Best Thai food in China Town!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Okay here‚Äôs must order at this place from a Thai food huge fan - Tong yum mama noodles, minced pork/beef rice with a fried egg, stir fried morning glory.

Super nice, the minced meat would be spicy but smells too good, I just couldn‚Äôt resist‚Ä¶"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Sensational. Scrumptious. Surprising. Satisfying. Speedboat.
I‚Äôve wanted to try Speedboat Bar for ages, and it absolutely delivered.

We dropped in after a day of shopping in London‚Äîme, my wife, and our son Thomas‚Äîand luckily managed to get a table without a booking. The staff were friendly and welcoming from the moment we walked in.

We started with corn fritters and crispy pork‚Äîboth full of flavour, crispy, and seriously addictive. But it was the mains that blew us away: naem fried rice, minced beef with holy basil, cellophane noodles with chicken, and crispy pork in black pepper sauce. Every dish was a total knockout. My son looked like he was about to lick the plate clean (and honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed him).

Dessert? Pineapple pie with taro ice cream and mango pudding with red pomelo‚Äîboth were next-level good.

Massive shoutout to Abigail, whose service made the meal even more special. Speedboat Bar was well worth the wait, and we‚Äôll definitely be back‚Äîwith a reservation and an empty stomach."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We went for a birthday celebration and left very satisfied. We were recommended two dishes by a fellow diner and they did not disappoint. The food was incredibly tasty, and the wait staff advised which ones were quite spicy which was a good warning. Every dish we ordered was packed with a flavoursome punch, the cocktails were delicious and the Leo Lager was the perfect drink!
We ordered the sweetcorn fritters and prawn civiche for starters. Both were delicious but the prawns were super spicy, we were advised to remove the fresh chilly on top if we didn't want them to be too hot (I did but my partner consumed them all!)
We also ordered the Morning Glory (incredible flavours) the Mince Beef (packs a punch of spice, delicious) the crispy pork (delicious but could have been crispier) and the wide noodles (my favourite!)
Finished off sharing the pineapple pie which was perfect.
The staff were all lovely and welcoming, and quick the take our order.
Spent ¬£150 for 2 with alcohol which I thought was very reasonable!
Delightful restaurant and will definitely be back!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The food was outstanding. Venison was extra tender and was just melting in mouth - definitely recommend this dish. Cooked to the perfection. Get it together with the broccoli salad which was crunchy and flavourful too. Octopuses weren't my personal choice so I can't speak of its preparation but my partner did enjoy them very much so they must have been delicious too!
To my taste, the deserts, despite served in a unique way, didn't steal the show that evening. We did like them though as they weren't overly sweet and the texture was perfect.
Atmosphere was perfect - quiet and serene - and the waiter who served us was able to help us select dishes and articulated the details of each dish very clearly."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,We enjoyed a set course pre-theatre meal. Our server Lana along with her colleagues were fabulous. Our dinner was wonderful and we highly recommend The Restaurant at St Martins Lane.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic lunch on their new summer menu. I was looked after Monika which I have to say was fantastic host that greeted me with a smile and carried it till the end. And the seabass, omg it was the highlight cooked to perfection!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Lovely experience of dining at the Restaurant at St Martins Lane. The staff was excellent. We chose the pre-theater meal. Food was delicious as well. The whole setting of the restaurant was quite interesting. It's a perfect place to dine before watching any west end shows in my opinion.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"My wife and I celebrated our Valentine's date at this restaurant, and it was an unforgettable dining experience. From the moment we stepped inside, the cozy and welcoming ambiance enveloped us, setting the stage for a truly romantic evening.

The menu was nothing short of impressive, offering a delightful variety of dishes that seemed to cater to our every craving. Each dish we ordered was a masterpiece, showcasing a brilliant combination of ingredients that danced together perfectly on the palate. The flavors were rich, sophisticated, and beautifully balanced, reflecting the high level of culinary expertise behind their creation.

Not to be overlooked, the drinks selection was extensive, featuring everything from classic cocktails to non alcoholic beverages, ensuring the perfect pairing for every course of our meal. The attentive staff recommended excellent choices that complemented our meals exquisitely.

In every aspect, this place delivered a luxurious dining experience that made our Valentine's celebration truly special. The care and detail put into every aspect of our visit were evident, making it a place we would highly recommend to anyone looking to create memorable moments over exceptional food and drink."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Went for a bottomless brunch. Food was off-the-scale delicious! Drink chosen to be bottomless was fab, and not watered down. Great brunch location."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"I ordered the theatre menu.
The food was good and everything was well made, the produce was fresh and high quality. But it lacked layers in texture and flavor. So even though everything was well prepared it still tasted a bit flat.
But all in all I had a good dining experience and the staff was very friendly, especially Juliana and Yvette."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"This was a surprising find, and a perfect pre-theater dinner spot. Although restaurants in a hotel are not always great, my friend and I really enjoyed their two-course dinner before running off to the theater. The pre-theater menu lasts till 7pm and it wasn‚Äôt crowded on a week night. Octopus salad and cod fish were cooked to perfection. Sweet potato fries were delish! Service from the rest of the staff was spotty but our server who spoke Spanish was very good and he was funny."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"From the moment we arrived, the service was absolutely impeccable. Every detail was looked after with care, professionalism, and genuine warmth. The atmosphere was lively yet relaxed, making it the perfect setting for a wonderful meal.

A special mention must go to Skender, who truly went above and beyond to make our experience exceptional. Skender was attentive without being intrusive, incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, and had a natural friendliness that made us feel completely at home. He made excellent recommendations and made sure we were looked after at every step.

It‚Äôs rare to find service that feels both five-star and genuinely heartfelt ‚Äî Skender delivered exactly that. He is a true credit to the team at The Restaurant.

Thank you for an outstanding experience ‚Äî we will definitely be back"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Our experience at St Matins Lane restaurant was fabulous. Monika was especially cheerful and helpful. We had the breakfast buffet attached to our room‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and I would have to say was the best breakfast buffet I have ever had at any hotel anywhere. Food was fresh and whole, not the cheap premix foods that are so often seen."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Amazing evening , surprise ‚Ä¶ our waiter was so attentive and kind . The food was beuon expectations. The dishes were amazingly delicious and presented like piece of art . This place is simply fabulous. The desserts were stunning"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Had a lovely evening. Was served by Adar and he was so friendly, and helpful. He gave some good recommendations. Thoroughly enjoyed our food. A lovely experience and so close to the theatre district."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Delayed post‚Ä¶

Haven‚Äôt been here in years !! Was soooooo good!! Pleasantly surprised actually!! Party of 7! Food was delicious and very tasty!!! Get ALL the desserts! Service was on point! Come here for conversations and catch ups, as you will need to bring the ‚ÄòAtmosphere‚Äô

Or head to the bar after too!
Definitely recommend! coming back again soon! Thank you!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,"It was our last night in London and we found this place with high ratings on Google. We got a main dish of ox cheek waygu and it was okay, not juicy, had a bone marrow sauce and was topped with more beef? The potatoes had no flavor. The sauce was gross but thought maybe it‚Äôs an acquired taste. We decided to try two desserts figuring no dessert is bad. Boy were we wrong. Both deserts the Black Forest and blackberry tart were absolutely disgusting. I‚Äôm not sure if something in it was off but the Black Forest was a strange consistency with no flavor and the blueberry tart had no hint of blueberry at all and instead tasted salty and nearly inedible. My husband who is too polite to say anything ate it all. We left and did not say anything, but it was the worst meal we have had in our life and came in at a super high price. I would avoid this restaurant at all costs. Wish we said something and saved $50 on the desserts."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Lovely place with a simple fixed price pre-theater menu and small Michelin star portions. Service was very well-coordinated and friendly. The dining room was too dimly lit and unfortunately quite empty at 6pm on Easter Sunday. I hope they are more busy and successful on other days. Overall a good balance of quality and price but the a la carte menu is probably too expensive for most
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,3.0,"The restaurant is at the ground floor of the hotel‚Äôs lobby. Nice interior and ambience. Staffs are friendly and service was fantastic.

Ordered the pre-theatre menu via Timeout. We paid ¬£30pp for 3 courses including a glass of house wine.

Had the octopus for starters, pan seared cod for mains and pear tart for dessert. Pear tart was quite good, the rest were ok.

Great place to catch up with friends in a less noisy setting. We also didn‚Äôt feel rushed to leave the restaurant."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Food was decent but a little pricey even if it was very nicely plated and served. Staff were attentive and helpful and overall it was a good experience although there was a little confusion over my OpenTable booking.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"There was a big group of us who hadn't seen each other in a very long time, so we were quite slow with ordering, but the attitude we received from the waitress and other staff was unnecessarily brusque.

We didn't let this marr the evening and when the food came out it was surprisingly good. I hadn't actually looked at any reviews, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was a really nice contrast to the service.

Between all of us, it felt like we ordered the entire menu, and everything we ordered everyone seemed to enjoy.

Just a shame that at every turn, the staff made us feel like we were putting them out."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Had a lovely meal in the restaurant at St Martins Lane. Food was fabulous and there was an interesting menu of cocktails, which we enjoyed with great quality olives.

The staff were friendly and attentive and keen to give good service and a great experience.

Note to management: please give James and Juliana a decent corkscrew! They were fantastic but hampered in their efforts to deliver a fine bottle of St Emillion because a poor quality corkscrew ruined the cork!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Wonderful restaurant. Highly recommended. Great pre theatre menu. Interesting food and excellent food.

I had the carpaccio and it was so delicious I asked the waitress to explain the ingredients. I then had the trout with delicious courgette with honey glazed carrots, which was also Delicious.

The sommelier was also very helpful. The proseco and carafe of pinot grigio went well. And it was kept cold which was very appropriate for a warm summer's eyening.

Well decorated. Nice ambience.

We shall return!

A great restaurant."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Had a nice meal in the outdoor terrace area. Lovely atmosphere and didn‚Äôt feel over crowded. I enjoyed my salad. Lovely presentation! There was a great wide range of fresh ingredients although I personally found the dressing was quite sweet which overpowered in places. The service was above and beyond! Extremely friendly and attentive.

We attended for a pre-theatre dinner.
A wonderful experience with fantastic service. Some interesting/abstract dishes on the menu that were fun to try.
The service was fantastic and the setting was romantic.
The camembert was incredible and the watermelon soup, although an obscure dish, was fantastic!
For mains we had sole & ribeye which were well presented and perfectly cooked.
Would happily recommend this to friends and will certainly be back."

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Great service from the start, was seated and seen to promptly
ordered a prawn starter which we honestly did not enjoy as much but I believe that was due to our palette and not the dish however the staff still noticed this even though we had not mentioned this to them and comped the dish from our final bill which we found very kind
steak was great and even managed to convert my partner to eating medium rare instead of well done after enough convincing from me
the presentation of all courses was great as well which is always important
as id mentioned it was a birthday occasion on our open table reservation the chef was kind enough to send out beautiful desserts for us making the day more special and after this the staff even invited us to visit ‚ÄúBlind Spot‚Äù for cocktails after our meal, where the atmosphere and drinks were amazing
here i was served a great old fashioned even though i asked for this specially as it was not on the menu, i would also reccomend the sydney and the copenhagen
overall great products with even better service thank you :)"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"I had a wonderful experience at Ellamia Caffe!

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,I sat in outside terrace and ordered a very tasteless glass of rose which took ten minutes as the unfriendly waitress who proceeded ti bring the 2 tables after Mr there drinks before mine. I also had asked for pink prosecco  the drink was ¬£17.90 not worth a fraction  beautiful hotel but this experience brought it down in my estimation
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Absolutely amazing experience, the staff was very friendly! I can understand it‚Äôs a high end restaurant but ‚Äúlet us breathe‚Äù don‚Äôt come to the table every couple of minutes to check on the food or pour the water which is a very kind gesture but no need at all!
This one staff member was absolutely amazing and super friendly which i loved and wished i got his name!"

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Very good service from the whole team especially Adan. They brought a surprise bday cake as it was my friend bday! Very attentive service throughout.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,2.0,"Impossibly slow service. The restaurant was mostly empty, plenty of disorganised waiters, each time a different person coming to our table and forgetting our request.

The food - lamb ribs were very good but served lukewarm, duck rillettes was bad, ratatouille was nice.

Atmosphere- soulless, nothing special, not like the photos at all."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Enjoyed the festive afternoon tea.

Food was great, especially the savoury selection. This is one of my favourite afternoon teas in London.

Staff are fabulous, in particular Monika was friendly and professional. She Made everyone feel very welcome."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The best meal I‚Äôve had in ages! Every dish was incredible, full of flavour and brilliant service. Our server Manuel was very attentive, thank you."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Lovely dining room, and servers were courteous and attentive. There were a couple of breakfast options for those who require gluten-free meals, but not sure if it would be celiac safe. Was a bit disappointed that the acai bowl is actually just yogurt with acai powder, but it was still very tasty. Full English was alright, nothing special. Unfortunately, the cappuccino ordered was only tepid in temperature, but when brought to the server's attention it was quickly remade. Overall, the experience was OK, but there are better options in the area for breakfast."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Restaurant at hotel! Breakfast is good and basic!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Wonderful tea service, including a vegan option.  The art in the room also has great character.  Our server Monika was also great and provided nice explanations of each tea service item.  Definitely a great experience!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Absolutely wonderful meal at this hotel restaurant. Very serious chef. Salade Nicoise and chicken were both terrific. Extremely good value for London. Their Rioja by the glass is also great value. Highly recommended.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"A lovely time with the family for my partner's birthday lunch. Bottomless brunch. Lobster Benedict was amazing.
Our lovely waiter Anastasiia was attentive at every step, Vivien the Manager visited our table to welcome us. Marek, the Bartender made an excellent birthday cocktail for my partner. Tobacco dock was delicious!

Thank you and will visit again."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Great service from our server Lana and amazing pre theatre menu. Food is absolutely amazing! Would definitely back !

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Had the festive afternoon tea with friends, and I could not fault a thing. Delicious food, welcoming staff, and lovely atmosphere. I will definitely go back again next time I'm in London."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Stopped for drinks after show.
Had great service and loved the relaxing atmosphere and beautiful setting."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"We were looking for somewhere to eat before a theatre show and found this. The food was excellent and Monika, our waitress, look after us extremely well. Highly recommended."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"We had a lovely dinner before our show. Our waiter, Manuel, made sure that the food came out in time, and helped us celebrate our anniversary."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Manuel was lovely and attentive, the vibe was quiet and pleasant, food presentation and taste were great although the portions were a bit small.

Chicken was sous-vide, so please consider if you don't like your food being cooked in a plastic bag.
Good vegetarian suggestions on the menu and excellent attention to food allergies from the waiter.

Charging 13.5% service charge and then asking the guest to state an additional sum for the tip and to write the new total has put us in an uncomfortable situation but overall a pleasant experience."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,The food was extra fresh and so many offerings at the breakfast buffet! Monika was especially pleasant and helpful!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"recently visited this beautiful place and it was nothing short of a delightful experience. From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome ‚Äì warm smiles, genuine hospitality, and attentiveness that felt personal without being overwhelming.

The food? Simply amazing. Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and clearly crafted with care.

What made the evening even better was the ambiance ‚Äì cozy and inviting, making it the perfect spot for both intimate dinners and gatherings with friends. Special shoutout to Vanessa, who went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,"We turned up as per our booking on Christmas Day and the restaurant informed us they are not doing  a la carte menu but during booking their website allowed us to book for meal without Christmas menu (¬£150 pp)

So misleading and completely ruined our Christmas."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Great restaurant! We managed to spend an unforgettable evening here with a boyfriend. It was a wonderful evening and not least thanks to the restaurant!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,I came to the brunch at St martins lane and the food was amazing! Besides the service from Frayer and Jo√£o was brilliant and very warm.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Lovely start to the day here every morning, and the hospitality of all staff, particularly Kohinoor was exceptional. Thank you for taking care of my mates and I! Can‚Äôt wait to return"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"We just had a fabulous afternoon tea with my 10-years old daughter in The Den.  All the food were perfectly presented in a stylish bird-themed china and the cake stand. The best bit was the taste - full of flavours and not-too-sweet.

It was clearly the best afternoon tea we have ever had (we even tried one at The Shard - was too sweet and too crowded ).

Juliana was so friendly and helpful with accommodating our dietary requestüíï

We will surely come back....for more!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,2.0,"We ordered an omelette and acai bowl. The acai bowl was not an acai bowl. It actually contained no acai at all and was just a yogurt base. When we asked our waitress about it she confirmed there was no acai in it at all and that it was just a yogurt bowl with fruit. It would have been nice if she would have flagged that the name was incorrect on the menu as we assumed the acai was mixed with the yogurt based off the name and description. It was good, but very disappointing at the same time as it was not what I ordered. I would have definitely ordered something else if I would have been aware. The omelette was very good with a lot of spinach which was a nice change up from other places that skimp on it."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Food was fantastic and the service was top tier! Juliana, our server, was simply amazing!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Great food, surprisingly creative and delicious  ‚ÄúBlack Forest‚Äù dessert , and a wonderful server in Aarati who was delightful."

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,I dropped in after the theatre for dessert. Manuel assisted in choosing a delicious pan Scott‚Äôs and a cheese plate. Superb service.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The afternoon tea at The Den was amazing, the taste and look of everything was amazing. We went with a 8 mo baby and the seating disposition left enough space for him not to be overwhelmed, besides that the staff was super friendly. Kahinoor served us the whole time and made us feel very comfortable and accommodated.
My mum, who is very picky about food, and my husband who is picky about the amount of food üòÇ  both left very happy after it.
The next table had a dog so it seems it is also pet friendly.
Finally, I can't help mentioning the decoration of the room that was funny and interesting, we had a nice moment checking the paintings."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"I‚Äôm staying at St Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel and had breakfast at the restaurant this morning. The continental buffet was solid‚Äîfresh fruit, yogurt, granola, and a decent pain au chocolat‚Äîbut the Shakshuka was the real standout. Frayer was attentive without being overbearing, making the experience seamless. The seating was surprisingly comfortable, and the atmosphere felt relaxed. I‚Äôm looking forward to breakfast there again."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"This place was really nice! Service was really good, they accomodated us as a walk-in, and we were treated really well. The atmosphere was super chill."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,"Look, we came here for the great reviews but we noticed a huge lack of execution. The service was fine but our cut of meat was not great and the dessert was off putting, there are better places to eat in the city, I would not recommend."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Great food. Great ambiance and top service firm Nuna!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Excellent restaurant, we got there by accident, but were absolutely satisfied with the quality of service and taste!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Our server, Manuel, was very friendly and helpful. The food was excellent. Our family had a wonderful time here celebrating me and my husband‚Äôs birthdays."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Atmospheric, cozy place, polite and smiling staff, tasty and interesting dishes. We went with a large group of colleagues."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Amazing food and service. Staff Manuel is friendly and surprised us with slice of cake for both of our birthdays. Definitely coming back again. Restaurant is just 6 minutes walk from the palace theatre. Had their 2 course pre-theatre menu
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"It was a very nice meal, the food was good and the waiter Adam was really sympatic."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Very well presented food, not cheap but everything was done very well.  Tuesday night was very quiet but that suited us wanting to catch up."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"My girlfriend and I attended the Den for Afternoon Tea. The food was delicious and selection of tea was great. Additionally, our waitress Aarati was very attentive and overall excellent. I would highly recommend this experience."

A bit pricey but totally deserving"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Came here for a meeting. The food was honestly exceptional was really surprised on how good everything was. Our starter with the beef pot, Yorkshire‚Äôs and gravy was absolutely fantastic, couldn‚Äôt recommend more. The steak were fairly tough but had incredible flavour was very impressed. Lovely atmosphere aswell, a must visit."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"We had the lunch set menu which is an amazing value. Yorkshire pudding was perfect. We had it with bone marrow with caramelised onions (not included in the set menu). Very unique and rich in flavour! No photo for the steak cos I just dove in. Steak was tender, juicy, rich in flavour, just perfect. You cannot find better value than this I guess!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"We visited Hawksmoor on Air Street yesterday for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday dinner, after my boss, who is a regular, highly recommended it. The restaurant is set in a beautiful art deco style with dimmed lighting. The food was delicious, and the service was polite.

From the moment we were seated, however, the table next to us, two women in their late 40s, made us feel uncomfortable by staring at us and pulling faces, as if questioning why we were there. Immediately, they began coughing repeatedly in our direction. There was empty space on their other side, yet the coughing still came our way. It happened so often that it was hard to ignore, and while I can understand it might be difficult for staff to notice something like this if they‚Äôre not standing nearby, it did have a big impact on our evening. My boyfriend and I didn‚Äôt discuss it at the time because they were right beside us, but afterwards we found we both experienced it the same way.

We waited about 50 minutes for our food, which felt long for this type of restaurant. In the end, we were almost grateful for the delay, at least the coughing didn‚Äôt happen while our food was on the table.

Had it not been for this neighbouring table, we would have had an amazing evening. I hope staff can be aware of similar situations in future to help keep all guests comfortable."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Honestly one of the best meals I‚Äôve had. Such good food, so tasty and so much satisfaction in every bite. The service was really great and the atmosphere was on point too and this was a Wednesday lunchtime. Cocktails and wine also delicious. Cheers!

Never been to a Hawksmoor before but will be a regular from now on."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Fabulous as always.
Special mention to our waiter Lucas - the service was perfect. He was helpful charming and great personality.
Big mention to Jam at reception we were a couple of minutes late and she checked in with us to make sure everything was ok.

Great food as always"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Came here for an early weekday dinner.
Ordered the Chateaubriand steak - was amazing and cooked as requested.
Tried the bone marrow sauce which was good, but nothing can beats the classic peppercorn sauce.
Waitress was amazing and was able to accommodate the steak portions with our table size and also the price.
However.. after checking the receipt, noticed they had charged full price on the cocktail drinks when they should‚Äôve been the ‚Äòhappy hour‚Äô prices.

EDIT: they've suggested for me to reach out to them following their billing mistake, however there isn't many way to contact them directly other than emailing through their website. I've tried this way but still not heard anything."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Love this place!  The food is delicious and a great value too. The wait staffs is attentive and friendly. we ordered from the pre-theater menu and the price you just can‚Äôt beat it.  The charcoal chicken Anna Mari is yummy, the Roast Hake  is light and moist.  The 25 day rump steak was a little dry, need the pepper gravy to make it tasty. What I love the most is the potted beef and bacon starter, dipping it in the gravy is so delicious.  A must try restaurant if you are in London and watching a show."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"This was a great steak house. Nice atmosphere. Great and friendly service.
We had for starters, bone marrow and onion really good the onion makes it and the belly ribs which was fine and tasted good but nothing to write home about. I would only have the bone marrow and onion next time and a bigger stake.
Rib eye 650g medium, really good and was perfectly cooked. anchovies hollandaise sauce is a must have. chips on the side was great.
Sticky toffee pudding for desert...yeah that is elite level desert.
Bryce provided amazing service and made the meal more special.
Recommended."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"What a fantastic meal! Started with bone marrow & onions, old spot belly ribs and langoustine scampi - all were delicious. Just look at that rib eye, beautiful cut and cooked for perfection! Beef dripping chips and macaroni cheese went great as sides. Will need to come back for their Sunday roast"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Had the BEST experience at Hawksmoor. Our waiter, Cosmin was exceptional. He was was attentive to my sister and I

He made me a surprise cocktail which was incredible - highly recommend

Sunday roast was amazing"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"I had the pleasure of dining at Hawksmoor Air Street last night, and I can confidently say that it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. From the moment we arrived, the service was warm, attentive, and incredibly professional. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything was perfect, striking the ideal balance between being welcoming and giving us the space to enjoy our evening.

The food was exceptional. The medium rare Chateaubriand was cooked to absolute perfection‚Äîtender, rich in flavour, and seared beautifully on the outside. Every bite melted in the mouth, reaffirming why Hawksmoor is regarded as one of the best steakhouses in London. The accompanying sides were just as impressive‚Äîfrom the indulgent potato mash to the creamed spinach and the perfectly seasoned bone marrow gravy, each dish complemented the steak flawlessly.

The drinks selection was equally fantastic. The wine pairing was spot on, enhancing the flavours of the meal, and the cocktails were expertly crafted, balancing bold flavours with just the right amount of finesse. The bartenders truly know their craft.

What really stood out, beyond the quality of the food and drink, was the impeccable service. Every staff member we encountered was friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely invested in making our experience a memorable one. They took the time to ensure that everything was to our liking and were more than happy to accommodate a request for a slightly more secluded table, making the evening even more enjoyable.

This visit was a special occasion, and I sincerely appreciate the effort made by the team to ensure it was an unforgettable evening. I cannot recommend Hawksmoor Air Street highly enough. If you're looking for a top-tier steakhouse in London with impeccable service, incredible food, and a refined yet relaxed atmosphere, this is the place to go.

A huge thank you to Alicia and the entire team‚ÄîI will most certainly be returning!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Good restaurant with great service, especially for steaks. The staff were attentive and the space is big and comfortable. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area and craving a good steak."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"My favourite steak restaurant in London! My favourite cut is the fillet, the creamed spinach is to die for!!! For every celebration we find an excuse to visit‚≠êÔ∏è. Also, make sure you leave room for dessert for their fantastic sticky toffee pudding"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"This was our second time round at Hawksmoor and they delivered. Our first experience was subpar but the service throughout our second experience was exemplary. A shoutout to Thiago from Hawksmoor Edinburgh for being so understanding.

The drinks are lovely, I‚Äôd recommend the Lychee martini if you‚Äôre after something sweet.
The food was exactly as you would expect, the meat was cooked perfectly and sides were impeccable. I would recommend the mac and cheese and the chips. The bone marrow was not a hit, would have liked it to be a bit more flavourful.
The highlight definitely has the be the sticky toffee pudding.
Alicia and the team were so knowledgeable and looked after us perfectly and we would definitely be back :)"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and was fantastic. It reminded me of a NY style steak restaurant. The food was excellent! As we were leaving, one of the managers engaged in conversation with us and ended up asking if we were celebrating anything. When we told him the trip was a ‚ÄòBirthday‚Äô trip, he ended up bringing us all chocolate truffles with ‚ÄòHappy Birthday‚Äô written on the plate. He really went out of his way to make our experience special."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Really lovely. Came for Lunch on a Saturday and it was really relaxed and empty. Service are very friendly and attentive.

We ordered a couple glasses of very nice wine, the Caesar Salad, 400g Sirloin, Bone Marrow add on, and sides of Garlic Mushrooms, Macaroni Cheese and the Bitter Leaf salad.

We were too full for dessert, but this was the perfect amount of food for 2. Would look forward to coming back to try a Sunday Roast!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Hawksmoor serves good steak üçΩÔ∏è. This particular branch is spacious, and very central. You walk in and go up the lift (or stairs, if you're into that) to the dining area.

There are quite a few steak options to choose from, as well as a variety of sides ü§§. The bone marrow side is particularly nice! Salad portion is pretty small. Steak is lovely.

They also have a bunch of cocktail selections üç∏. I think they go down quite nice with the steak. A bit of deviation from the standard red wine doesn't hurt.

It's not excruciatingly expensive, but not cheap either. You get what you pay for.

You can takeaway, if circumstances force you to, but only after you have ""dined"" your meal a bit i.e. taken at least one bite out of your food.

Service is great, though when it's busy it can be hard to get attention.

Overall, it's very nice for special occasions, family dine-out, or date night! Just check the menu beforehand and ensure it's within budget. ‚ú®"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"One of the best dining experiences I had in London!!
We arrived a group of 8 people and everyone was very satisfied with the food and the service. We were served by lovely Alexandra who did above and beyond for one of us who was not happy with her steak, and tried her best so everyone will be pleased.
The meat was delicious and the desserts were amazing.
Had a great time, would love to come back again next time I visit London."
Hawksmoor Air Street,3.0,"I recently dined at Hawksmoor Air Street and had a generally enjoyable experience. The service throughout the evening was attentive, friendly, and professional, and the atmosphere had the classic, polished feel that Hawksmoor is known for.

The food was well-executed‚Äîsteaks cooked to perfection, rich in flavor, and clearly high quality. While the sides were delicious, the portions were on the smaller side, especially considering the price point.

Unfortunately, the evening took a disappointing turn toward the end of our meal when we saw a few mice run across the floor of the dining area. We immediately informed the front-of-house staff and asked to speak to a manager. We were told they would pass along the information, but we were not given any follow-up or assurance that the issue was being addressed.

It‚Äôs a shame, as the overall experience up to that point had been quite positive. I truly hope management takes this matter seriously, as it's not something you'd expect to encounter at a restaurant of this caliber. With its strong reputation and excellent food, Hawksmoor has the foundation to provide an exceptional dining experience‚Äîso long as issues like this are promptly and transparently resolved."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"A place for relaxing and gathering with a good atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Always have a smile. The pudding was fantastic,I finished in no time. Very thoughtful after I mentioned it was my son's 19th birthday ,they prepared a small message for him on his pudding dish. I was very touched ( even my son was embarrassed).
However,the steak was a bit chewy despite the rump steak.
Having said that the restaurant is worthy to visit and enjoy to have a good time."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"We really enjoyed our experience dining here, it‚Äôs a fun location and the food was delicious. My only complaint is that they really pack the tables in there to fit as many people as possible and it felt a bit crowded and got pretty loud. I would definitely recommend the potted beef and bacon starter, it was amazing."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Visiting London from the US and wanted to try a chophouse here in the UK. Hawksmoor has charming art deco decor, my wife loved it. But more importantly, the serve reserved, well prepared steaks. There was nothing over the top about the presentation, but the steaks are very nice cuts of meat. We tried several sides, the garlic mushrooms and mac-n-cheese were particularly delicious. Our server was from Poland, sorry, forgot her name. However, she made thoughtful suggestions and really took good care of us. Definitely recommend for a nicer evening."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"We visited for a Sunday roast and had such a wonderful experience! Our server, Rhys, was extremely helpful, professional, and polite throughout ‚Äì nothing was too much trouble, and he really made us feel well looked after. The manager, Alicia, was equally attentive and went above and beyond by giving us thoughtful recommendations for things to do after our meal, which we really appreciated. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was welcoming, and the service was exceptional. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great dining experience"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Had my Birthday Lunch at Hawksmoor Air Street on the 21st of December.
Even though my group was a bit late staff were absolutely amazing and accommodating.
I shared 700gr of Chateaubriand, Mac & Cheese and 2 fries portions with 2 friends and it was the perfect amount. The best meal I had all year for sure. The meat was cooked to perfection, so tender.
Then I shared a sticky toffee pudding with a friend and again, amazing. Glad I shared though cause it is sweet.
We initially had the table only until 2pm but we ended up staying longer to open gifts and talk. We were not rushed out or anything.

Overall amazing experience and will return for sure."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"I had the most amazing 50th birthday meal with my brother on the may bank holiday weekend. It was wonderful , produce was clearly excellent and everything i tried tasted sensational"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"After a long day of walking, we were starving and went to this beautiful restaurant. We had the Sunday Roast and ordered sides as the kids weren‚Äôt too hungry.
Sunday Roast - the potatoes were amazing and the steak was good. The vegetables tasted super delicious and my toddler kept eating the carrots.

Sides
We had mac and cheese- it tasted expensive and did not taste like the unhealthy and cheap mac and cheese

Atmosphere
The atmosphere was amazing. Fully packed but we were very happy.

Service
Was on point. Even though the place was packed we had a designated server who served us the entire time here and it was very pleasant."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Easter Sunday meal. Food was delicious. The wine was good too. Highly recommend but a bit pricey.
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"I went here last night with my friends for a 21st. There was 7 of us and we had a really nice table, and the service was really good considering how busy it was. One issue was we asked for one of the cheaper bottles of wine, and they gave us a different, more expensive one. The wine was still really nice though. For starter I had the hawksmoor smoked salmon which was so tender and with the bread was great. I had the pleasure of trying the bone marrow too which, for the price, id definitely recommend it was so good. For main I had ribeye steak, peppercorn sauce, and me and my friend shared the beef dripping chips and creamed spinach. One thing I‚Äôd say is the steak came out ever so slightly more rare than medium rare but it didn‚Äôt bother me. The chips were really nice and crisp but you don‚Äôt get many so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend sharing. The creamed spinach was also very nice to compliment the steak. I got to try some mac and cheese on its own which was very good too id recommend that, just not sure how it would‚Äôve complimented the steak"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Good food and good service. Tried their signature Sunday roast and a fish main dish. Both dishes were very well executed. A bit pricey but worth going to for a special occasion. The service was impeccable
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"After seeing all the YouTube videos about Hawksmoor, expectations were sky-high. It was good but not exceptional. The staff doesn't wear uniforms but private clothes, which is unusual for a restaurant. The staff is running back and forth and is quick to refill your water, and for this, you pay an ""optional"" 12,5% service fee. I don't feel it is optional, and I prefer the system where you can enter tips on the card terminal. We went for the Express menu, which had three starters, main courses, and desserts. You can choose two dishes for ¬£29 or three for ¬£33, which is quite attractive. We decided on the potted meat and bacon starter, which was both delicious and a rather big serving. The rump steak was tasty but a bit tough, and it didn't come with any sauce (you can order sauce separately). The watercress salad was fresh, though. We decided on different desserts, but the passionfruit Pavlova was refreshing. The restaurant is boisterous, and this is not where to have an important conversation."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"One of the best Sunday Roast and toffee pudding Ive had. The toffee pudding  set the standard very high. Im not into sweets at all but I was able to finish the dessert.

Service was great, attentive, timely and not too pushy. The place was very busy but the food arrived warm and the staff were very friendly and kind.

Definitely family friendly and organized.
Will definitely come back."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Delicious food in a charged environment. I love coming here. It's got a great vibe - full of energy. But noisy and you have to speak up to be heard but aside from that the food is great and service is good too. Come here for a fun night out with friends rather than a serious business meeting.
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,Great food and good service. Pre theatre menu very good and well priced.
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"As soon as we entered we were looked after. This was our special Anniversary dinner and it did not disappoint! My partner had to convince me to come here in the first place as he wanted the steak. I hummed and ahhed about it for a few weeks before giving into him and I am so glad I did! We had some cocktails to start, after drinking all afternoon I needed something to eat fast. So we ordered some bread and butter for the table, and the butter was the best I have tasted in a while! We then ordered the steak, and the charcoal chicken ana Mari and we were both in heaven! The chicken was beautifully cooked and had a lot of flavour. We then ordered dessert, which we ordered a sundae, not knowing if the sticky toffee had dates in as my partner cant stand the texture. We were given a sticky toffee pudding and ice cream on the side, which was comped immediately even though we were more than happy to pay for it. I have never been more pleased for a wrong order! The sticky toffee pudding was heavenly, and perfectly matched with the ice cream. We were so happy we got that instead of the sundae at we got the delicious hot sauce that came with it. The staff were so attentive and couldn't do enough for us. If we are ever near a Hawksmoor again we will make sure we go in for dinner!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Been twice in one month and both times food was great. Lovely filet beef with fries and greens. And if you have any room left, I‚Äôd definitely recommend trying the sticky toffee pudding!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Made an unplanned stop here for dinner and had no issues getting a table but must have timed it just right as the restaurant soon filled up. We started with cocktails, I would highly recommend the full fat old fashioned. For dinner we shared a porterhouse steak and a couple of sides which was more than enough for the two of us, the server advised us on the size of the steak to ensure it was adequate. The steak was exceptional and the bone marrow gravy was delicious. There were plenty of wines to choose from and staff were very attentive topping up our glasses. The restaurant itself is nice and has an art deco feel about it, the entrance is grand and there are arch windows throughout. A visit here is expensive but worth it, all food and drink was of a high quality and the service was excellent. I would highly recommend a visit!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Dining here was a lovely experience, the staff were friendly and attentive. The food was great and everyone in my group enjoyed their meal."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Definitely splashed out and Hawksmoor definitely delivered.

Everything chosen was of exceptional quality. It was a very busy lunch service but everything delivered promptly, sexy looking and incredibly tasty.

Don't have anything to add except - go here at least once when you're in London!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,3.0,"If you‚Äôre a tourist and don‚Äôt know the nuances of a good Sunday roast, then this is an acceptable place. If you‚Äôre a Sunday R connoisseur, then you‚Äôll see through it quite quickly. Staff are great but the roast is max 3/5."
Hawksmoor Air Street,1.0,"Service was exceptionally terrible and totally ruined our lunch. The lady at the reception on 1/F who led us to our table was very rude. The restaurant was less than half full. There were 4 of us all with a few bags after shopping. We asked for a slightly bigger table next to ours but she pulled a long face throughout and rejected us outright as it was ‚Äòunavailable‚Äô (which of course had been vacant throughout our lunch). We then asked another waitress, who also pulled a long face, for an extra chair for our bags, and she questioned why we did not ask for the bigger table next to us. She also told us we could have gone back to the G/F ourselves and drop off our bags at the cloakroom. The 2 other younger waitresses were friendly though and we were happy with the food. But the overall experience was very disappointing and definitely not what I expected from Hawksmoor. DO NOT RECOMMEND. There are many better choices at this price range.
This is by far one of my worst dining experience in London."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Sat at the bar tonight and was looked after by Eldar. Incredibly knowledgeable on the drinks, attentive without being overbearing - couldn‚Äôt have asked for better service. The drinks were absolutely incredible, but I‚Äôd come back just for him. Best experience I‚Äôve had in London, can‚Äôt recommend this place highly enough!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"This is my fourth time here. I never disappoint. Had my friend Birthday Lunch at Hawksmoor Air Street on the 6 January. We got a nice table. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Always have a smile. The steak was delicious. We were pleasantly surprised by the candle and 'happy birthday' written on the plate!
Definitely coming back again ü•∞üòä"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"EXCEPTIONAL SUNDAY ROAST

If you‚Äôre in London, do not sleep on this outstanding steak house.

We went for Sunday roast, and it was out of this world! Meat was juicy and tender, and all the sides were top - amazing gravy as well.

Service was top notch, in particular our server from Hungary was excellent!

Also, do not sleep in the sticky toffee pudding - amazing!

Will definitely be back to try their other cuts!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Everything is always so consistent and delicious, which is why we often come to celebrate special occasions.

We dined on 20/08/2025 @ 19:45. Please pass on our thanks to the amazing staff in particular:
- The waiter in the white shirt (vague, I know) he was serving us cocktails in the lounge area.
- The guy at the desk on the 1st floor who took us to our table (checked or striped shirt) he was just incredibly gracious and courteous.
- Our waiter (black polo top) who was incredibly patient, kind, knowledgeable and just looked after us really well all night.
- Finally, of course the kitchen team who consistently put out delicious food.

Thank you! üëèüèº"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Absolutely amazing experience! The steak was cooked to perfection‚Äîtender, juicy, and full of flavor. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, perfect for a relaxed dinner. Special shout-out to our waitress, Zainab, who truly made the evening exceptional. She was not only professional and attentive but also incredibly friendly, adding a personal touch that made us feel genuinely welcomed. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Great Atmosphere. Friendly and professional staff and welcome. We ordered Sunday Roast, which was a superb and  lovely meal... must do medium pink for the roast beef. I recommend and would definitely return. Thank you."
Hawksmoor Air Street,1.0,"Very poor experience all round. We were a group of five on a Saturday lunchtime.The food was brought to the table barely warm. My fish was not cooked. All commented that their dishes were tasteless. Service was unsmiling, grudging and monosyllabic. We have eaten at Hawksmoor in Shoreditch and Guildhall many times. The contrast with the food and service in Air Street could not be greater."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Absolutely gorgeous! Fantastic juicy meats and brilliant place! Recommend for family and friends.
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Came specially on a Saturday for their full English breakfast, and it did not disappoint! Every component was delicious and well executed. We ordered the portion for 1 and added a salad, which was enough for 2 to share. The 2 pax portion has a bacon chop instead of a bacon. One of the best full English breakfasts I‚Äôve had"
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"We dropped in for drinks mid-week between lunch and dinner.  Despite visiting during a transition time, they took good care of us.  We tried a variety of cocktails and they were all very good.  The service staff was very helpful and accommodating.  The bar are is comfortable and well appointed.  We have eaten here in the past and it was very good.  Returning to the Hawksmoor for a cocktail is on our list of London favorites.  We look forward to our next visit."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"We shared a big steak porterhouse which was lovely. Had creamed spinach, fries, mac and cheese as sides. Had the most amazing sticky toffee pudding ever for desert.
Also had some ribs and steak pie thingy. All super.
Would definitely visit again on our next visit to London.
Prices were reasonable for this food I thought."
Hawksmoor Air Street,1.0,"Was attracted by the fantastic review... Decided to enjoy the dinner BUT, it's a great disappoint to be honest.

Service: the service staff was very impatient to begin with.

Food: was the most disappointed. Ordered a medium rare rib eye but was served Welldone with a little pink in the middle only. Yet the manager still told us that its medium rare. Oh come on!  But but but, the bone Marrow is awesome to be honest. But no point ordering the the onion Marrow for an extra 5¬£. Side dish, fries, mashed potato and creamy Spinach is just very normal. Nothing fantastic about it...

Hope I'm the only customer that received such 'fantastic' treatment..."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"My friend and I were celebrating 47 years of friendship and I wanted to share this beautiful restaurant with her as she had never been. The staff were so welcoming and we had a lovely little space to ourselves. We took advantage of the Monday wine club, where corkage is ¬£5 per bottle and we had the pre theatre menu of ¬£19 for 1 course. We had steak, chips and salad and the food was perfect. Our waiter Fenil was friendly and when he found out it was a special occasion,  he organised a delicious peanut butter pastry with ice cream on the house for us to share. A very affordable meal in sumptuous surroundings."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"This is my go to lunch spot when I‚Äôm errand running in the city.

The food is good quality and service is excellent.

I had Kos as my waiter during my last visit he was charming and attentive. The level of professionalism you expect from a far more expensive restaurant."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Come for the steak, stay for the sides. Service is impeccable, the food is delicious and the restaurant is just lovely. We shared two steaks with a couple of sides, two glasses of wine, shared a dessert and a little digestif all for ~160 GBP"
Hawksmoor Air Street,1.0,"Came to celebrate for my significant other‚Äôs birthday dinner. It all went downhill the minute we were sat down. Our waitress never came back to take the order for so long that in the end we had to stop someone else to take our order, and the food didn‚Äôt even come out until over an hour and 15 minutes later. We ordered scallops and mussels for starters which were nice, but the porterhouse 800g was a disaster. It was overcooked and very rough, as if we were chewing a chunk of rock. It was very dried out for a medium rare and so tough that we cannot chew. We jokingly said to each other that the only thing enjoyable about our mains was the chips since the steak was not edible. We told the waitress about the steak, but she insisted this is how it should be. I have been to many other steak places, including hawksmoor (which I enjoyed before hence I decided to come back), which never came out medium rare to be this tough and overcooked but we were completely ignored. A celebration experience completely ruined."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Came here for dinner while in London. The vibe and decor is classic steakhouse style. We went on a Friday and it was packed! I tried their take on a classic dirty martini which included olives and spicy peppers. It was quite good. For dinner, I had the filet with b√©arnaise and added the brussel sprouts with bacon and chestnuts. The food was delicious, but it is quite expensive and the steaks all come solo and the sides have to be added a la carte. So, expect to spend $60 or more at minimum. However, it was a great meal."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Great 3 course set menu including bring your own booze (BYOB) with ¬£5 corkage. Food was good (I had a mackerel salad and steak frites as mains).
Lovely restaurant, friendly staff and a wonderful meal. Recommended!üòÉ"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,Had an amazing time with my boyfriend at this restaurant for his birthday. The steak was delicious and so were the mussels too! We were pleasantly surprised by the candle and 'happy birthday' written on the plate!
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Had a great meal here on Sunday with the wife, we had visited London for the day and this was my first time visiting this restaurant in any location.

First thoughts were how big and busy the place was, wow! Second was what size steak I could fit in and still be able to walk around afterwards.

I opted for the salmon starter which was so tasty. Salmon was fresh and smokey. The wife had the dressed crab which was equally high quality with plenty of flavour.

For the main I went for the 400g rib eye cooked medium. It was bang on for me and extremely tasty, I wish I could eat one a week if I'm honest. The lady chose the beef roast dinner, the meat again was fantastic; nice and pink just as requested. Unfortunately her meal was a little cold and veg was hard so she left those bits. Overall though it was a great sitting.

We washed our dinner down with a nice bottle of red wine after a couple of cocktails before our starters to wet the whistle. The drinks menu was extensive and very high quality.

The lady waiting our table was very friendly and helpful, enjoyable company throughout our meal.

An all round great visit and I will definitely return when I'm back in London for another solid meal."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Quite noisy. The food was excellent and the staff knowledgeable and eager to help. We shared oysters and the half native lobster, while getting a main meal each. The drinks were nice as well."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Listen. Imagine a bear‚Äôs cave but that bear has a degree in interior design and doesn‚Äôt shit on the floor where it lives. Welcome to the Hawksmoor Covent Gdn, Pronouns: He/Him
A classy mancave with Parquet floors, exposed brick walls, minimal lighting, pleated glass and lots of action.
It‚Äôs in places like the Hawksmoor you wish they hadn‚Äôt banned smoking in public because a thick layer of smoke kissing the ceiling would round things off rather nicely thank you very much. It pleases me to imagine a diner with a big fat cigar in one hand, a beef rib in the other. Lost in the moment she takes a big toke on the rib before biting into her Montechristo 2. Damn you nanny state for seeing to that scenario. Still, this cellar and former brewery retains the requisite magic to believe it could happen.
The Hawksmoor concept remains achingly simple and unwavering. You come here for big steak. Porterhouse, ribeye, Tomahawk, Chateaubriand. You order chips to go with it and you order a choice of robust sides to go with the chips and you sit there squeezing in cow flesh fearlessly wherever there‚Äôs still room in the duodenum. It was a hit when it opened in Shoreditch in 2006. It‚Äôs still a hit now.
18 years sourcing and cooking basically the same thing every day has made them experts in their field. They understand the chasm between medium and medium rare. They know how to carve up a tomahawk so that all you have to do is hover your fork and decide which piece next. The effort of dropping the fork onto the meat and lifting it to the mouth requires energy and therein lies the secret of your perpetual motion.  They leave just enough meat on the bone to tempt those who understand life is too short not to grab it like a Rottweiler would if it only had hands.
A Porterhouse to share and a ribeye for birthday boy. Chunky chips all round. Sauces of peppercorn and Bernaise. Spinach - creamed for those who need lubrication to get green stuff down or a simpler lemony version. Mac and cheese for plugging any holes. But before this, just to prime the gut like a Tesla does to its battery before a supercharge, Scallops in garlic sauce and bone marrow on toast. All come in prime condition. Garlic, butter and parsley can make a garden snail edible so what‚Äôs not to like about bathing well burnished scallops in the same brew? Nothing as it turns out. Marrow comes in the shin bone that housed it sliced vertically down the middle. Two half pipes. It all slips down very easily. I‚Äôm already sweating umami.
Steaks come without pretension. The Porterhouse has been dissected, the ribeye untouched. Accompanying sauces stick without cloying. Mac and cheese is unnecessary and they knew this when they devised the menu. For this reason they make it great, just for those brave enough to take it on. Nice touches like the crispy crumb demonstrate the care. When it‚Äôs this simple it should be flawless and they oblige. The lemon in my spinach wasn‚Äôt an apology and all the better for it. That‚Äôs the key to the whole thing. No apologies. Chips are crispy, fluffy and chunky. Is there anything more you could ask from a chipped potato? The combination of these things is eminently satisfying to the extent that eating becomes painful. The machismo and bravado the Hawksmoor elicits in women and men alike  turns the meal into a war of attrition. Human v food. Human wins, just.
I remember going to the original Hawksmoor in Commercial Rd soon after it opened in 2006. I was taken aback by the quality and simplicity of the fare but less enthralled by the venue. The Hawksmoor group neatly saw to that when they opened the Covent Garden branch. It‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs simple, it‚Äôs powerful and after 18 years it‚Äôs still a thrill to descend into this cave, even if the ascent two hours later is something of a heave."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"AWESOME!!! I've been twice the last five days. If you like proper cooked meat and I mean medium rare then go. Otherwise don't  waste a prime quality meat and the time and effort of chefs... Among the best restaurants in the world. Exceptional service, nice atmosphere and outstanding food. My first time that I'm having porterhouse steak (it's the top of T-bone) and it was unbelievable tasty and juicy. We tried almost everything and every dish is full of flavour. Potted Beef & bacon and pork belly ribs are must try dishes. Definitely I highly recommend this place"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Everything about the meal was exceptional. Price point is very good but a 3 course meal with a couple of drinks for two can easily run over ¬£200-250. Its expected for the quality but with the service charge can come as a bit of a shock to some who may not be used to spending as much on a meal out.

I would say the steaks are reasonably priced however I feel the drinks and sides are a little more expensive than they should be.

However I cannot pass any fault at all to the quality of service, attentiveness of our host and the quality of the food. If you've never eaten at Hawksmoor, please make an exception to try as it is 100% worth making time for. You will not be disappointed."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Finally tried Hawksmoor Air Street and it lived up to the hype. The roasted scallops were a standout‚Äîrich and perfectly cooked. I had the rib-eye, which was smoky, tender, and full of flavor. We also shared the Chateaubriand‚Äîpricey but excellent. Sides like beef dripping chips and bone marrow gravy rounded things off nicely. Not cheap, but a great spot for a proper steak night."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"A great dinner with wonderful service from Vanesa & Team.
The mussels were excellent and would definitely have again and recommend. We shared a 900g Porterhouse which was well cooked. A bit more of nerve than I expected and next time I will take the Prime Rib.
Overall, a really great meal and excellent service. Thank you! Look forward to coming back."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"Their take on a full English breakfast is only available at this Air Street branch, and on Saturdays only. I think they‚Äôve nailed the beans, harsh browns, tomatoes, mushrooms and the addition of their notable grilled marrow. It added a rich flavour that pairs beautifully with the sourdough toast.

While the honey roast gammon chop was delicious, I did find it a touch dry. The sausage was decent, but not remarkable. The gravy was also quite thin. I am not the biggest fan of black puddings anyway so unfair to judge. I think meat lovers would be craving more meat. ¬£50 for two people, we were really filled. The service was great and very friendly."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,A great Sunday roast and an even better service! The staff was amazingly friendly and polite! Thanks!
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful restaurant, very friendly well trained staff. We had the Sunday roast which was excellent, my wife loved the roast potatoes (my wife never likes roast potatoes in restaurants, so high praise). The stuffing was superb, the desserts heavenly can't wait to come back & try the steak. Their Martini is also very good."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Always great at Hawksmoor, a birthday tradition of ours. This branch in particular has great atmosphere and lovely decor. Had the fish for the first time and was not disappointed, the sea bass was very well seasoned and perfectly cooked, great if you don't feel like having meat every time. The beef fillet was beautiful but it was served very salty, so we sent it back which they accommodated graciously and brought a new dish, perfectly seasoned. They also replaced all the sides (even though we had already eaten them!).
The only small issue was the pears in the cheesecake dessert were under-ripe, to the point of tasteless, it's a beautiful dish, probably better not to put the fruit on if it's not ripe.
Highly recommend: the scallop starter, fillet/rump steaks and the creamed spinach!"
Hawksmoor Air Street,3.0,"Good food, esp the express menu. Decent atmosphere. Extremely slow service by wait staff. Food came out quick actually. I don‚Äôt see why it can be that hard to order food (had to keep asking and eventually asked another server to place the order). Your wait staff are obviously overwhelmed and understaffed"
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"Pro Tip: Monday is Bring-Your-Own bottle, with a corkage fee of only ¬£5.

Stepping into Hawksmoor Air Street is an immersion into sheer elegance - it's my unequivocal favourite Hawksmoor. The reception staff consistently greet you with warm smiles, setting the tone for a delightful dining experience. Ascending the marble elliptical staircase to the first floor unveils a captivating art deco interior, a huge chandelier, emerald-hued leather booths, and a meticulously restored parquet floor from an old RAF base.

While Hawksmoor has always excelled in steaks, this particular branch stands out with its expanded repertoire, featuring an array of fish dishes that rival the excellence of their renowned steaks. The steaks are perfectly cooked and properly rested as there are no juices on the plate, when they arrive My personal recommendation is the Chateaubriand this always goes down well."
Hawksmoor Air Street,4.0,"I loved atmosphere, service and most of the food. I ordered lots of dishes and was really excited about steak. That‚Äôs where bit of let down is. Steak was bit too chewy which is their specialty. I have been to Hawsmoor‚Äôs other branches and it‚Äôs my favourite steak. Loved Lobster and all of other dishes."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"I really enjoy the experience at this restaurant! I tried the beef Sunday roast, and it was delicious. The potatoes were very crispy, and the portion size was generous. The restaurant's decor transported me to the 60s, and the service was very attentive. I highly recommend it, and the prices are quite reasonable for being in Piccadilly."
Hawksmoor Air Street,5.0,"What a lovely experience! I was here for a friends birthday, and a MASSIVE SHOUT OUT to Reece and Elisia. My steak wasn‚Äôt the best, but the staff kindly made me another, and wanted to make sure we were happy. Elisia went out of her way to then give us birthday cocktails, and ensured we had a memorable night. THANK YOU!!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"My wife and I came here for our anniversary.

The food was exquisite and I would highly recommend both the non alcoholic and premium wine/beverage pairings. We were really lucky to have Isabelle guide us through our wines.

It was also lovely to find out we had extra courses but those should be a surprise (although the bread may have been the best bread course I‚Äôve ever had). Would recommend without reservation."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Our experience at Evelyn‚Äôs Table was truly special. The intimate counter setting made the evening feel personal and immersive‚Äîwatching the chefs at work added a thoughtful touch to the meal. üë®‚Äçüç≥‚ú®

The portion size was perfect‚Äîenough to feel satisfied without being overly full. We opted for the non-alcoholic pairing, which was incredibly well thought out and paired beautifully with each dish. üçπ

Two standout dishes for us were:
ü•á The crab with courgettes, almond, and elderflower‚Äîa refreshing and delicate start.
üçì And the dessert of strawberry, shiso, black sesame, and raw milk‚Äîso creative and beautifully balanced.

The service was warm and professional, and the chefs were friendly and open, making us feel welcomed throughout.

Highly recommend for a unique, refined dining experience in London. A true hidden gem. üåüüçΩÔ∏è"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"This restaurant was worth the wait, being only 12 seats means this place is hard to get a reservation for, but if you do, you are in for a magical meal.
Every dish was amazing and would recommend the wine pairing ""the path less trodden."" The team explains each dish and bottle and it shows the thought and care that has gone into each dish.
From the menu we had, the standouts were the mere trout, lamb and cr√®me br√ªl√©e but none the dishes will leave you disappointed. We can't wait to visit again."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"We had an amazing experience here. The service, the knowledge and friendliness of the sommelier and the chefs, the food. It was all really great. It was really cool to see the chefs prepare everything in front of your eyes. The only minor faults I can think of was that the duck, while really nice, was a bit chewy and definitely not at the same level as the other dishes. And the truffle add-on was not worth it at all, it didn't add much. But we will return at some point :).

P.s. this restaurant seems to be bombarded with fake 5 star reviews ATM."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"One of the best dinners I‚Äôve ever had. Every single dish was incredible, and the wine pairing was perfect. They were also amazing at accommodating my wife‚Äôs dietary requirements during her pregnancy. A perfect place for a celebratory dinner."
Evelyn's Table,3.0,"Tucked away down a side street entrance beneath a traditional pub, Evelyn‚Äôs Table is an intimate, almost hidden space. Descending a narrow staircase, you arrive in a dimly lit, compact dining area with a notably low ceiling. The room is centred around a marble chef‚Äôs counter seating just 12 guests, evoking the exclusivity of a high-end chef‚Äôs table experience. The seating area was cramped, elbows bumping and jabbing into each other and other physical encounters due to throughfare movement.

The restaurant offers a fixed tasting menu concept. I chose the pescatarian option, which ‚Äî according to the menu I was handed ‚Äî featured just one alteration from the standard selection. Everything proceeded smoothly until the main course, when I was unexpectedly served duck. For a venue of this calibre, this was a significant oversight. Serving duck to a pescatarian diner ‚Äî when an alternative (Pollock) was clearly intended ‚Äî is a serious lapse in both communication and attentiveness from the kitchen and front-of-house team.

The tasting menu itself, although advertised as five courses, was more elaborate in practice, incorporating amuse-bouches, palate cleansers, and petit fours ‚Äî making it closer to eight courses in total. In fairness, I chose not to flag the error, curious to see whether any member of staff or the chefs would notice or correct it. None did, which was disappointing.

The evening began with three amuse-bouches, the highlight being a beautifully clear brown crab broth ‚Äî delicately balanced and deeply flavourful.

Standout Dishes:
‚Ä¢ Crab, Courgette, Almond, Elderflower: A refreshing and elegant dish, where the elderflower film delicately topped a rich crab mixture subtly lifted by mayonnaise.
‚Ä¢ Mere Trout, Tomato, Cucumber, Radish: Lightly grilled or blow-torched trout, perfectly cooked but very small in portion.
‚Ä¢ Turbot, Girolle Mushrooms, Tarragon, Vin Jaune: The standout course of the evening. The sauce was reminiscent of a refined lobster bisque, and the fish was immaculate.

The main should have been the Pollock with Bobby Beans, Cherry, and Endive ‚Äî a well-balanced dish on paper. However, I was served duck instead, which was unfortunately metallic in taste, slightly chewy, and entirely out of place on a pescatarian menu. In hindsight, I regret not saying anything in the moment.

The palate cleanser, with miniature basil leaves, was creative and refreshing, followed by a beautifully presented dessert:
‚Ä¢ Peach, Raspberry, Verbena: A delightful combination, full of fresh, summer flavours.

Drinks:
‚Ä¢ The Negroni was expertly balanced, though served in a surprisingly small pour.
‚Ä¢ The Pisco Sour, by contrast, was overly sour and lacked finesse.

Conclusion:
Evelyn‚Äôs Table delivers a refined, immersive chef‚Äôs counter experience with some excellent dishes and creative touches. However, the serious error of serving duck on a pescatarian menu ‚Äî without recognition or apology ‚Äî undermines the professionalism expected at a Michelin-starred restaurant."

Evelyn's Table,5.0,"There are one Michelin Starred restaurants and then there‚Äôs Evelyn Table where the experience and the food is just more than flawless technique and execution. The warmth of the staff hugs you like a cozy blanket making you feel at ease, and this includes the Chefs, taking the time to diligently explaining every single dish to each diner, one by one, with a friendly smile on their face. Every dish is a masterclass of delicacy, and yet familiar and comforting. Sometimes you get ‚Äúsecret courses‚Äù between dishes and one notable one we had was the home made sourdough Bread. Yes, we were left in awe by something so simple like a bread course: the texture was incredible and there were so many layered flavour exciting the tongue one after the other, from the nuttiness of the fermented butter that accompanied it to the smoky after taste, so simple yet so unexpected! One thing is for sure, Evelyn‚Äôs Table deserve a second Michelin Star. Immediately."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,Attended Evelyn‚Äôs table for my birthday dinner. We had the set table top menu which was beautiful paired with local UK wines and even a sake. Would recommend if you like fresh light seasonal produce.

Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Had a wonderful meal here! Loved the open kitchen + chef‚Äôs table feel of the restaurant. Every dish impressive and consistently good. Service was smooth and the som very knowledgeable, worthy of their michelin star ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Evelyn's Table,5.0,"An amazing experience with phenomenal Chefs! We celebrated birthdays and every part of the dining experience exceeded our expectations.

Evelyn's Table,5.0,Omg what can i say but wow.  Not only was the service amazing but the staff and food was outstanding.  The ambience and all round great feeling this restaurant provided was great. My new regular spot to eat and share a bottle of wine with my girls. Definitely recommend üëåüèº

Evelyn‚Äôs table was another notch. Above love the decor. The food  spot on  every where I looked were smiles. Gasps how good it is
Not happens very often but quality quantity  and pricing
I was made to feel it was all about me staff amazing  I‚Äôm going again and again"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"An unforgettable experience that transcends dining‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey for the senses and the soul. Evelyn‚Äôs Table is more than a Michelin-starred restaurant; it‚Äôs a place where food becomes art, and emotions take center stage. One particular dessert, with its delicate white chocolate notes, transported me straight back to my childhood‚Äîa testament to the power of culinary storytelling.

Each dish is a masterpiece, from the aromatic Cornish Pollack to the exquisite Mallard, presented with precision and passion. The wine pairings were equally extraordinary‚Äîeach glass came with its own story, like a captivating bedtime tale for adults, perfectly complementing the meal.

The open kitchen adds to the magic. Watching the chefs work in seamless harmony, creating dishes with such finesse and without a sound, is nothing short of mesmerizing. The waitstaff are equally remarkable‚Äîattentive, knowledgeable, and committed to ensuring you feel utterly pampered.

We floated on a cloud the entire evening, completely immersed in the experience. This is, without a doubt, one of the finest restaurants I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of visiting. I hope these words do justice to the brilliance of Evelyn‚Äôs Table."
Evelyn's Table,2.0,"One of the worst service ive had for a michelin star restaurant. Two girls on duty the night we went. They collect your plates without asking if youre done. Ordered a bottle of wine and they didnt serve us till we asked for it. Left our bottle of white wine at room temp and did not serve us till i had to ask if we had any wine left. The remaining of our white ended up warm‚Ä¶
Kitchen staff were cleaning right after main was served. Wasnt very pleasant seeing them scrub the stains while we were still eating. The room was very hot and stuffy and people not customers from the restaurant would use the toilet so the toilet was dirty like public toilet.

Lastly, they DO NOT reply emails. it‚Äôs crazy. I emailed them 3 times, even dm ed them and no reply. What kind of michelin service is this. dont think they deserve a star at all."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,the only fine dinning experience that i would say is worth every penny. i am definitely coming here again.
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"Generally I dislike the 'chef's table' experience but staff were warm, friendly and attentive.  The food and drinks pairings were surprisingly good and the food was certainly better than expected.  Great presentation- worth a visit."
Evelyn's Table,3.0,Overall good experience / decent quality but I think it‚Äôs overrated on Google/social media. The summer menu feels to me a very strong association and seasoning with seaweed (from starter to main dish) which is both very sweet and savoury (probably too salty). So unfortunately I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a balanced and well designed menu.
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Evelyn's Table is celebrated for its exceptional tasting menu and expertly paired wines. Guests consistently praise the refined flavors, fresh ingredients, and creatively presented dishes. The ambiance is described as intimate and relaxed, making it an ideal spot for a special meal. Staff are noted for being knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Lovely little spot with only a dozen seats.

Everything was great, but I especially enjoyed that:
- each course was served and explained by the chef or one of the other two cooks
- it's super easy to see what is happening in the kitchen since it's right there and the seating is high enough to be able to see everything
- the staff asked us casually why we were in London, then ended up giving us a card at the end congratulating us on our anniversary. I hadn't mentioned that during the booking so they did it spontaneously.
- they had a non alcoholic pairing with some interesting drinks, some home made"
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"On paper this place ticks all my favourite boxes.

Was it my favourite place, no, was it good, yes but it could have been soo much more.

It's a nice experience, the setting it great, intimate, you feel special but...

It was the first tasting menu that I was hungry afterwards, the chef interactions were pretty poor, it was expensive and didn't feel it valued the bill at the end.

We did have a nice time, our waitress was fantastic, and it was a good group of people at the table.

Tucked beneath a quiet pub on Rupert Street, Evelyn‚Äôs Table feels like London‚Äôs best-kept secret. With just 12 seats wrapped around a chef‚Äôs counter, it‚Äôs intimate, dimly lit, and quietly theatrical. You‚Äôre not just eating ‚Äî you‚Äôre part of the kitchen‚Äôs rhythm.

The vibe is calm, creative, and deeply personal. Chefs talk you through each dish with warmth and precision, while soft music and candlelight set the tone. It‚Äôs upscale, but never stiff ‚Äî more like dining in a friend‚Äôs (very talented) home kitchen.

Expect seasonal, modern British food with global touches, served with care and soul. Book fast ‚Äî seats go quickly.

Vibe: Intimate, creative, quietly cool
Perfect for: Food lovers, anniversaries, solo indulgence"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Evelyn‚Äôs Table is a hidden gem. The intimate setting makes it feel really special, and the food is outstanding ‚Äî creative, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. Service is warm and attentive without being overbearing. Perfect spot for a memorable evening. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Seating wise was slightly crammed, but other than that, everything else was perfect. We were extremely full by the end of it and enjoyed most of our courses."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"I had a lovely experience at this restaurant. The food was fresh and full of flavor, especially the grilled chicken and house-made sauces. The staff were friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The atmosphere was warm and relaxing ‚Äî perfect for a casual dinner or small celebration. Definitely worth a visit!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Here, guests can watch the chefs meticulously prepare each course, which I personally am a fan of, as this close interaction with the chefs offers a rare glimpse into the behind the scenes of every dish, making each bite even more special."
Evelyn's Table,3.0,"Not worth it to try. Not at the level of Michelin one star. Only the appetizer is good. 5 course on the memu are very ordinary, Third course Very saltyÔºàVeryÔºÅÔºÅÔºâ  Pork is very dry abd difficult to chew. I didn't expect this level of food to be rated Michelin star. There's one more important thing‚ö†Ô∏è the final dessert with cleaning the countertop togetherÔºÅjust next to each other. The hygiene situation is worrying."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"Evelyn‚Äôs Table is located under a busy bar in Soho, very close to Chinatown.
The menu changes every two weeks, offering customers a varied experience.
Tonight, I tried the Scottish native lobster and  Cornish pollock, along with tender pork belly, beautiful peach raspberry desert‚Äîvery new English style . Surprisingly, you have to pay for the 5-course tasting menu before your visit. The food was cooked to perfection, top quality, and it was a lovely time for dinner between 8:45 PM and 11:00 PM."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"I was a bit nervous booking this for a special occasion given that the reviews are either 5/5 or someone saying that people are being paid to leave 5* reviews. We had a lovely time at Evelyn‚Äôs table but I did feel that it was quite overpriced, especially for the wine pairings which weren‚Äôt particularly tasty and included a foul sake. The plates were very small, while meticulously crafted, and it was very cool to be able to watch the chefs preparing the dishes, however I would say overall that I‚Äôve had better fine dining experiences."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Evelyn‚Äôs Table is a hidden gem ‚Äî intimate, refined, and unforgettable. The chef‚Äôs tasting menu is beautifully curated, with every dish showcasing creativity and bold, balanced flavors. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and warm, creating a relaxed yet elevated experience. From start to finish, it felt personal and a true culinary experience, not just a meal. Easily one of the best dining experiences in London"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"We had a great time at Evelyn‚Äôs Table. All dishes are well presented and explained by the lovely staff. Can only recommend, it‚Äôs a great experience, amazing food and great playlist. The team even reserved a table for us for a pre dinner drink in their wine bar upstairs. Only point to mention is that we felt a bit rushed - they have two sittings a night at 6 and 8.45pm."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Adorable intimate dining, only a dozen or so seats and all at a counter overlooking the chef's working, great experience, food was exceptional, staff were super friendly and informative. Highly recommend the half-half on the drinks pairing that way you can venture into more adventurous drinks!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,Very good experience. They have maintained its quality since the start 6-7years ago. Really loved the wine options and the hospitality from even before starting dinner. Was a personal fan that they have a couple of Sake options
Evelyn's Table,5.0,The best food I have ever tasted!!!! So worth it!
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"What can I say... I've been to various different restaurants in London, many Michelin Stars and nothing came close to this.

The attention to detail, the outstanding service, the ambience, the care and the small details made this an absolutely remarkable night.

I couldn't believe that all the chefs actually signed a birthday card and handed it to my girlfriend for her birthday.

Thank you so much to all the staff, you guys are the best."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"A very good restaurant with excellent tasty food, all served by a pleasant courteous and hospitable staff.
I loved eating here, and I will return soon to taste again the culinary delights.
A very lovely experience."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Good experience from start to finish.
The food was exceptional, Staff attentive and the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming. A lovely place to have a cozy evening. Surely recommend it for anyone that wants value for their money."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,This was one of my favorite tasting meals of all time! The chefs were polite and interesting in their introductions and placement of food. The service was perfectly timed and paced. Very fresh take on ingredients and flavors. It felt closer to a 2 Michelin star restaurant. Thank you for a wonderful and memorable meal!
Evelyn's Table,5.0,A wonderful tasting menu experience. My guest doesn't eat red meat and they were very accommodating. Great friendly service. Highly recommend.
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Absolutely superb. I had high expectations and they were surpassed. Unless you really hate counter seating (and the seats here are relatively comfortable for counter seats), you are going to love this place. Service was spot on, atmosphere was just right, food was consistently divine throughout the meal and pricing was what you would expect at this level (dinner for two with a pairing and service came in at slightly under ¬£500 - of course that's an extravagant sum, but if there's a special occasion and you value fine dining, I'd highly recommend)"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"It‚Äôs definitely one of the best Michelin starred restaurants dinning experienced I had.

British produce, and Scandinavian and Japanese techniques and classic French touches.

It‚Äôs really difficult for me to decide which dish is the highlight of the day.

Worth visiting and will come back again ü§©"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"What a fabulous evening and amazing gourmet experience! The food was delicious, the wines excellent and paired perfectly, and the service flawless. The setting is unique and intimate, contributing to the overall experience with the food being prepared in front of you. Truly one of the biggest highlights of our London dining adventures."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"We really enjoyed this restaurant and rate it really highly. The menu is mostly fish, so best for any fish lovers. The restaurant is very small so it is definitely wise to book in advance. However it isn‚Äôt too busy if you want a pre-theatre option, try arriving before 6 and see if they have a spare table. If you do make it here, you MUST try the ragu and the lemon tart, both were truly exceptional."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Was in London over the weekend for a family reunion and was recommended Evelyn's Table, and we were so glad we went on Friday Night. The atmosphere Decor and food was amazing. Would highly recommend definitely a 5 start dining."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic restaurant, food and staff are outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble. I will definitely be returning. Thanks again."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant food and wine compliment each other. The atmosphere is just out of this world.
The ambience is electrifying.
It's a must to go place as a couple or by yourself.. There's plenty to do before you tuck in..."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,I booked it for me and a female friend and we had such a good time we're more than friends now. Service was great and the food was amazing. Very classy. We will be definitely going back.
Evelyn's Table,1.0,"I've visited Evelyn's Table twice before when it was run by the Selby brothers. This year, James Goodyear took over as head chef. The format remains the same, with a tasting menu featuring five main courses and two accompanying snacks. The dishes retain some Japanese elements in their seasoning. While the flavors weren't as impressive as my previous visits, they were still quite good overall.

However, my experience was marred when I found a wriggling insect in my bowl while eating the Day Boat Fish dish. Likely it came from the decorative plants. When I informed the chef, he brought over James, who after examining the bug, removed it with tweezers and crushed it, assuring me it was just the skin of a bean and not to worry.

I can understand the occasional insect in organic vegetables, and even if they explained that they couldn't replace the dish due to limited servings, I'd understand. However, simply destroying the evidence and offering such an explanation made me feel unpleasant."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Getting a reservation at Evelyn's Table feels like finding a golden ticket, and the experience more than lives up to the immense hype. Tucked away in the cellar of The Blue Posts pub in Soho, this is not just a meal; it's pure culinary theatre.

From the moment you descend the stairs, you leave the bustle of London behind and enter an intimate sanctuary dedicated to food. With only a handful of seats wrapped around the kitchen counter, you have a front-row view of the magic. Watching the small team of incredibly talented chefs work with such precision, calm, and passion is a performance in itself.

The tasting menu was a sublime journey through the very best of seasonal British produce, exquisitely elevated with Japanese precision and classic French techniques. Each course was a work of art, both visually stunning and a symphony of perfectly balanced flavours. A standout for us was a delicate dish of Cornish seabass with a subtle citrus dressing that was simply unforgettable, followed by a piece of Iberico pork so perfectly rendered it melted in your mouth.

What truly sets Evelyn's Table apart is the interaction with the chefs. They present each dish personally, explaining the ingredients, the inspiration, and the cooking process with genuine enthusiasm. It creates a connection to the food that you simply don't get in a traditional restaurant setting. The optional wine pairing was expertly curated, with each glass thoughtfully chosen to complement and enhance the dishes.

This is an experience for a special occasion, for a true food lover, for anyone who wants to be reminded of how powerful and exciting food can be. Yes, booking is a challenge, but it is worth every ounce of effort. Evelyn's Table is a true jewel in London's culinary crown, and I am already plotting how to get back. Unforgettable."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"A lovely restaurant with a top notch services. The food was delicious, the staff were kind, and the place felt warm and welcoming. I had a wonderful time and would love to come back again."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"I cannot fault the food, it was exceptional. Particularly the trout which was sublime. Service was also exceptional. However I'm a wine lover and the pairing was beyond bad at ¬£80 I expect the the best given we getting 125ml per course. The intrusion of a cider was nonsensical, it was bubbles all the way down and mostly white with the only red tasting flat, I'm not even going to mention the dessert wine. If you go, order a bottle of wine and be done with it, cos the food is fantastic üòç"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Evelyn‚Äôs Table isn‚Äôt just a restaurant‚Äîit‚Äôs a secret portal to a parallel universe where food tells stories, wine speaks fluent poetry, and chefs move like culinary ninjas in an open kitchen ballet.

I came for dinner, but left wondering if I‚Äôd just attended an edible opera.

The Cornish Pollack was so delicately seasoned, I half expected it to recite Shakespeare. The Mallard? A moody, brooding masterpiece with the kind of flavor depth that deserves its own novel. And then came that dessert‚Äîwhite chocolate sorcery that whisked me back to my childhood faster than a time machine made of sugar.

Wine pairings? Think bedtime stories for grown-ups‚Äîexcept instead of tucking you in, they wake up every one of your taste buds and ask them to dance. The service was so smooth, I briefly questioned if the staff were psychic.

In short: Evelyn‚Äôs Table is less ‚Äúdinner out‚Äù and more ‚Äúspiritual awakening via fork.‚Äù Would I go again? I‚Äôm already planning my next pilgrimage."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"5 Stars
Excellent service and a truly original experience! I loved the atmosphere‚Äîit's in a fantastic spot, tucked away just enough to feel really special. A hidden gem that makes you feel like you've discovered something unique. 100% recommended!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"The most incredible experience. Cannot fault the service, food and incredible atmosphere, everything was perfect! We loved the langoustine and venison in particular, but were blown away by every course. The sommelier and chefs were so lovely when explaining our pairings and dishes - Book in advance and absolutely make this a must visit. Thank you!!!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Beautiful, intimate setting and seeing the Selby brothers in action at the kitchen counter seats! The menu during my visit seemed to be Japanese influenced, which was right up my alley. Every set was commendable and the flavours all combined well together! Will definitely be back."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,This dining experience was absolutely outstanding. We've had the opportunity to eat at some world class restaurants... and this was absolutely one our top (some 3* ones really pale in comparison). Loved it and can't recommend highly enough.
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"After hearing about Evelyn‚Äôs table from a friend we decided to book a table for two for dinner after attending the theatre in soho with my partner and I. Located in the heart of the west end next to Leicester Square, we made our way to be seated at Evelyn‚Äôs table upon arrival we were warmly greeted, after being lead through the establishment by the front of house we were amazed by its rich history and elegance. Our five-course evening tasting menu for ¬£135 per person was out of this world, compliments to the chef and front of house the scallops to start were beyond delicious and our main course was out of this world. Evelyn‚Äôs was a great experience and highly recommended 5 stars all round."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"üò≥ wowzas! I‚Äôve been to some incredible restaurants, but this was something else. The intimate basement setting was the perfect stage to this culinary experience. Watching the chefs at work, both mastering the kitchen and hosting the guests in a personal, fun manner brings the whole evening to life. The delicately curated dishes were a sensation on the eyes as well as the taste buds. My favourite part however, has to be the wine pairing and the deeply thoughtful and eloquent introduction to the vineyard, production technique and grape, the sake was like nothing I‚Äôd have before, the sommelier was so passionate and warm. A really unique and special place. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Wonderful experience.
We stayed in this intimate restaurant and it was all wonderful.
mennu made up of 5 courses and recommend pairing with wine.
Everything was perfect from eating to drinking to serving.
Very nice to eat and see the chefs cooking for you and the very knowledgeable sommelier put us at ease.
Really Recommend!"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"A truly unforgettable dining experience.
The food was exceptional, the service was warm and attentive, and the atmosphere was intimate and beautifully curated. Every course was creative and full of flavor. Highly recommended for a special night out."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"There aren‚Äôt words to describe how wonderful dinner was at Evelyn‚Äôs Table. They should have more than one Michelin star. The entire experience was perfection from the second we walked in the door. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, the chefs were very personable while making mind blowingly good food. Every dish was fantastic and the wine pairing was very unique and exploratory. Even the music selection was perfectly executed for the feeling of the space and the meal. It is worth every penny and second invested in having a meal here."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"The cuisine menu was adorned with an array of Japanese-inspired elements: varsity uses of miso, fish roe, seaweed, etc. all intricately woven into the dishes to add nuanced touches rather than dominate, maintaining a European fusion essence.

Started with an exquisite two-ways of Cornish fish appetizer, which was, without a doubt, my highlight of the evening. The warm dish was a marvel of texture and taste‚Äîtender fish enveloped in konbu leaves, roasted to achieve a perfect balance of moisture retention and flavor infusion. The sauce was a delicate blend of fish roe and seaweed powder that enhanced the umami, making the warm dish an embrace of comfort. The cold dish offered a refreshing contrast, with sashimi brought to life with leeks and a zesty apple sauce.

Continued with a first main course of Iberico pork, showcasing three distinct cuts‚Äîshoulder, butt, and leg‚Äîdrizzled with basil leaf oil. The dish was paired with a non-alcoholic drink left a lingering spiciness, courtesy of jalape√±o, that was nothing short of mesmerizing.

The second main dish scallop sliced and accompanied with four distinct methods of swede preparation. Sourdough and beetroot cream cheese came to transition between courses, striking a rare balance.

The final Lake District venison served a decent conclusion to the main courses, although didn't quite captivate as the previous dishes had.

The predessert rejuvenated the tasting experience‚Äîlemon jelly and panne cotta-alike milk custard accompanied by a trio of honey and fruits embodies a balance of sweet and sour.

The dessert, ambitiously combined the homemade vanilla ice cream and hot truffle caramel sauce, was a bit overwhelming, at least to our tolerance. The intention was bold, but the presence of black truffle felt out of place, casting a shadow over the otherwise harmonious blend of red beans and ice cream.

Overall, I enjoy the boldness of experiencing the combination of different flavours, truest adventurous and worth tryingü´∂"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"When a friend suggested joining her at Evelyn‚Äôs Table, I wasn‚Äôt sure as it seems expensive. But I am so happy I decided to go. The food was amazing, service mostly good. Each dish explained and everything a pleasure except perhaps dessert on the day we went (far too cloyingly sweet) but every other dish was spot on! Atmosphere (ie other diners) was rather subdued as there was an air of quiet seriousness about food (I think we were given a couple of looks for laughing as we were chatting - but it was just the day we went. It is a 12-seater restaurant so very dependent on who is there on that sitting). All in all I would recommend going at least once.
PS you can arrive early and have a drink at their bar upstairs."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"The best meal I've had this year to date. Super cosy atmosphere with mega friendly staff and chefs who you are inches from as they prepare the food. The tuna tartare was next level and the hake with sweet corn was the meal of the night. So tasty and balanced to perfection. The wine the waitress helped us choose was perfect. We were on a tight time frame so don't expect to while away the hours here, but if you're looking for excellent food, excellent drinks and excellent service, then give this place a bash."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Really great restaurant, with a pop up feeling and counter like seatings. Food is exceptional and the menu has a variety enough of dishes, including fresh fish well explained by the chef, we could chose between hake, cod or crab. Wine list it's pretty good as well. Price value quality could be one of the best at the moment. Puddings options are available as well in case you have a sweet tooth."
Evelyn's Table,4.0,"Some of the dishes were excellent, but the space felt cramped."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"OMG ! The picture will talk for themselves... It tasted even better than it looks.
The service is outstanding (Just make sure to not be late to avoid being a bit rushed by the waiters), the drinks good and the chef brings the food to the next level. Good value for money. The concept of 11 seats only and the dinner at the counter make this a full and unique foodie experience."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Relaxed, informal and extremely delicious. We loved the way you can chat to every chef as they each take turns to present different courses. Super place I would love to go back in the future. We also had a pre dinner seating at the wine bar upstairs which is a must to get the full experience, the sommelier is top class."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"A marvellous meal.

To ensure a relaxed seating process (and likely upsell of decent plonk) you‚Äôll most likely be escorted to the wine bar upstairs before you are seated in the basement restaurant space. Do not fill up on the addictive bar snacks (come back when you‚Äôre not dining downstairs)

I‚Äôve been a fan of the food from this restaurant group for years - the menu's not cheap but the food is consistently good which is a mark of quality. The last time we ventured downstairs the food was Italian, tasty but pricey and as we kept ordering to try more dishes it ended up being quite pricey.

This visit we found the front of house team at Evelyn‚Äôs Table the right amount of friendly and the chefs good natured in the face of a silly amount of cellphones during service (which I too am guilty of)

Like most good tasting menus, you‚Äôll find yourself pleasantly full despite the Lilliputian portions. Whilst the  ‚Äúsecret‚Äù slash ‚Äúbonus‚Äù dishes (sorry, courses) deliver the perception of value, they‚Äôre so fun and tasty you‚Äôll wish there are more ‚Äúhidden‚Äù courses.

Recommended for those who genuinely like food and flavours,  British seasonal produce with a typically London mix of flavours and cuisine and aren‚Äôt looking to be seen and just want a nice dinner. The price point makes it more of an occasion than a weekly dinner, and I‚Äôm looking forward to visiting each season for a pay day treat"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Unreal experience, food was amazing, chefs attention to details is well noticed. Front of house are brilliant and recommend great wine."
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"Could really not have loved this anymore. An intimate experience, delicious food, excellent service, passionate chefs and sommeliers‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve definitely paid more for less fabulous tasting menus. Will definitely be back next season! Thanks to everyone in the team for such a lovely evening"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,"This is a difficult to get type of restaurant. The space is an intimate basement 12 seater counter with 3 chefs that cook and present their creation in front of you, and 2 sommeliers that guide you through the possible combinations of wine pairing. We were 2 and chose the traditional pairing and the ‚Äúnatural wine‚Äù pairing in order to explore the taste and flavour combinations. The food is extremely good, the flavours range from modern to classic to experimental, with mods to seasonality, Asian influences, modern British, techniques are classic like the usage of beurre blanc, salsify, yuzu and other touches that let you grasp the complexity of the cooking which went into each carefully prepared dish. They have 2 seatings, we had the 6 pm one, and there is another at 8 pm if I remember correctly. The tasting of Cornish fish to start with was sublime, followed by an
Outstanding British iberico presa dish, the Orkney scallop and the venison with mushroom and smoked juniper, some stout bread with a cr√®me fraiche and beets ( delicious) plus the Jerusalem artichoke dessert followed by a chocolate log with a ganache of hazelnut inside. The service is great, attentive, and full of enthusiasm, the 2 sommelier are both passionate, competent and fun to interact with, the chefs are friendly and very polite, the food is incredible. The only suggestion I have is to have a dedicated pastry chef, as the desserts are the last part of the meal, and I thought that, albeit being good, they were not as delicious as the mains. Anyway, the dinner was magical and I am looking forward to see this place gaining a 2nd Michelin star !"
Evelyn's Table,5.0,Amazing place family friendly! My child is very picky but staff was amazing to help find what is the best option for her. Food was delicious..thank you definitely will come back soon
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant! Loved everything, and the service is insanely good, best I have had in ages, so huge thanks to our waiter for being so awesome! :) food great, champagne amazing, cocktails perfect ü•∞  will defo be going back. üëå"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"The place was recommended by our friend and probably that is why we hoped for amazing experiences. The food was ok, nicely served, but nothing more. The place is all right, the atmosphere is intimate, although the tables are close together, but it doesn't bother. There is a button at the table to order champagne.
We were told to make reservation so we did. It wasn't full.
It took us 40 minutes to get to the restaurant from our hotel and we passed many good looking restaurants on the way and maybe that's why we don't know how to appreciate this place"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Party of three came here for a birthday dinner and we loved it!
We had been meaning to try this spot for years and it did not disappoint. The venue is beautiful, and the decorations and interior design are mindful in creating a retro style that feels like a break from 21st century London.
As a starter, got the scallop, lobster and shrimp pelmeni which were simply mind blowing; the flavours were distinguishable but blended great with the lobster bisquet.
As mains, we got the steak tartare and tuna tartare to share which were also delicious; the quality of the product was noticeable and we especially recommend the tuna tartare, which is served with a soy and citrus dressing which really elevates the plate and brings out the richness of the tuna. We also got a main serving of the truffle potato and mushroom vareniki, which was rich, earthy and tasty.
For desserts, we ordered the flaming creme br√ªl√©e which was frankly perfect, and the BBR Signature Chocolate Glory, which was a whole experience, tasting different chocolates with different textures and not too overwhelmingly sweet. Additionally, since we came for a birthday, they brought a complementary dessert with a candle to blow.
The service was outstanding; the waiters are attentive and kind, making the experience even more enjoyable.
Would recommend for any special occasion, 10/10!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Bob Bob Ricard, the original in Soho, is opulent, glamorous, and playful inspired by the Golden Age of travel and luxurious train carriages like the Orient Express.

The food and drinks were all excellent, our table had prawn cocktails, oysters with vodka shots and smoked salmon for starters. Mains were beef tartare, fish pie and lemon so, all delicious.

Our waiter Danny was very smartly presented and provided just the right level of service and entertainment! Thank you, you were the magic ingredient that made it a memorable evening.

The restiarant design features a mix of Art Deco and retro elements, with rich colors, plush seating, and plenty of mirrored surfaces. A key element is the ""Press for Champagne"" button at each table, which adds to the sense of playful luxury.

The decor incorporates creates a sense of stepping back in time.  The entire dining room is comprised of booths, reminiscent of dining cars on a luxurious train.  Each booth is equipped with the famous ""Press for Champagne"" button, summoning bottles of champagne to the table.  Marble tabletops, brass finishes, and copper accents add to the lush feel.

Like this review if you find it helpful!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,3.0,"The atmosphere is great, it‚Äôs a throw back to many years ago.  The disappointing part is they may be leaning on the building history and haven‚Äôt improved with the times.  The food was average and service was less than expected for the price point.  It may be focusing on champagne buttons instead of high quality food and service."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Visited with a party of 10 coworkers and we all had a brilliant evening. Our server, Fidan, was friendly, funny, and accurate with his recommendations. Exceptional service.

The food was good, although the portions are small ‚Äî as you‚Äôd expect from such a place. Definitely try the sticky toffee pudding. The Champagne button was a fun novelty and the decor was lively and somewhat quirky as the theme was Wes Anderson‚Äôs film, Phoenician Scheme.

Overall a good place to dine (particularly if your company is footing the bill!) and a big kudos to Fidan for making it extra memorable."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Service was wonderful, staff were warm and friendly. I asked for an unusual coffee (in the UK); not a problem.

Loved it."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,Me and my friend were interested in eating the Beef Wellington. It Takes around 45min/1h to cook. It‚Äôs worth every minute. The manager Ricardo is a true gentleman and very competent.
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,2.0,"This one is hard for me to review.  On the day we visited, I was very pleased that we went there. It looked like a great place for special occasions, full of charm and a luxurious, calm atmosphere.  Booth seating added privacy and intimacy to a dining experience.  The staff was friendly and attentive and helped to decide what to order, but service of the food was very slow, considering the fact that the restaurant was not busy. I really wanted to try the Beef Wellington, but it only can be ordered for two, and my dining party had different idea what to order. I wasn't very impressed by the menu choices though. We ordered Steak tartare as a starter, Cottage pie, and Stinking Bishop Cheese Souffl√© with Truffle chips as a main courses. Although it was said on the menu that  souffl√©  can be ordered as a main, it was a starter and shouldn't be offended as a main. It was tasty,  and it filled me up, but after couple spoonfuls I wished I ordered something from main menu. The Cottage pie was delicious. What ruined all the good memories was a horrible food poisoning with a torrential diarrhea that both of us had next day after sharing stake tartare for starter. It took me over a week to recover and lots of painkillers day and night. Wouldn't recommend anyone."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"BBR is somewhat struggling with being too popular. Dinner seating is capped at 2hrs which is hardly enough to consume starters, mains and desserts accompanied with drinks. We experienced being rushed along a bit by the staff which obviously isn't what you're looking for during dinner. That aside the food is great (beef tartare and beef wellington highly recommended) and absolutely warrants a visit. When our time was up we were lucky to get seats at the bar and stayed for another three hours as the atmosphere is really nice and drinks are good. Unfortunate dinner reservations couldn't be for three hours instead of two."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We visited during the Wes Anderson Phonecian Scheme ""Marseille Bob"" collaboration and I adored it - the bar was quiet when we visited at 6pm for some post-theatre drinks, so we got to really soak in the atmosphere and drink at our own pace.
We tried all of the alcoholic collaboration drinks and found them all not only tasty, but visually pleasing - the Hand Grenade was refreshing and smooth, and the black ""Tycoon"" drink even had a gimmick where it was ""tested for poison"" and turned black. Bottoms up!
Whether or not you're into Wes Anderson, I think this cocktail bar has a lot of personality and is worth a visit."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We really enjoyed the pre-theater set menu of salmon tartare, filet mignon and creme br√ªl√©e. We added oysters with caviar which were delicious. I have a gluten intolerance so our server provided a delicious gluten-free bread with the tartare. The filet was cooked a perfect medium-rare and we added truffle mash and green beans on the side, which were a must. While we didn't press the button for champagne, that was a cute touch and was very popular with the other tables. Bob Bob Ricard also has a great list of N/A cocktails and bubbly for those who don't drink. We were also pleased with the lovely service. While we originally booked a bar seat, the host was able to get us a table once we arrived. If you're prepared to spend $$$ for a nice meal, you can't go wrong here. But if you'd like to stay on budget, the set menu is a great price on its own."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Dining at Bob Bob Ricard on a Wednesday evening was a wonderful experience. When we arrived around 18:30 we were guided downstairs to a beautifully decorated room and the fact that it was almost empty added a really special touch to the ambience. The highlight apart from the decor was the incredibly friendly service, the waiter who was looking after our table was very pleasant and always came back to check on us at the perfect time. The food was also delightful, the mains were tasty but the dessert in particular stood out to me - both the cr√®me br√ªl√©e and the souffl√© were just perfect. Overall the combination of food, ambience and service made this a five star worthy experience for me."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"What a stylish hidden gem of a bar/restaurant and to be able to try champagne by the glass that you wouldn‚Äôt normally be able to find is a real treat. However, we thought the food was a little expensive, although excellent.."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,1.0,"This was the last time that I will ever eat at this restaurant!
My family and I have never been so rudely treated by a member of  staff (manager )within an establishment like this !Marco was the rudest  most confrontational person I have ever met! All other members of staff were great !
3 members of the dining party ordered chateaubriand which arrived with a cold sauce on all 3 , they were all sent  back to the kitchen and like all 5 star establishments thought that 3 new dishes were being made.
Instead the same 3 pieces of meat were sent back out to us 10 minutes later but my piece of meat that I had sliced into was given to my daughter !!!! This is absolutely disgusting on every level of health and hygiene!!
And the level of customer services from Marco was appalling, to say that meat can be re cooked and sent back out is wrong and then to accuse us off being rude because we were complaining about the standard of food is shocking !!!

I shall be contacting the health and safety agency for this borough over this issue.
This establishment used to be so good but will never set foot in one ever again."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,2.0,"Very disappointing experience. We decided to visit Bob Bob Ricard on a whim to check out their Phoenician Scheme themed pop-up bar. Apparently they'd 'transformed' their red room to resemble elements of the film... what they'd actually done was put a few fez hats on the waiters and offered a very small themed cocktail list with pretzels as bar snack. The cocktails were, to be fair very nice. The service, however, was incredibly poor for a place that puts a 14.5% service charge and ¬£1 per person cover charge on the bill. Firstly, the waiter that gave us our themed cocktails said not a word to us or indeed looked at us. My cocktail required a few drops of blue liquor from a pipette, a nice fun touch, but administered silently, sans the fun. The pretzels we ordered never arrived. We reminded our waiter but eventually our mains came out and so asked for them to be cancelled from our order. The waiter then confessed that he had meant to tell us the pretzels were finished but he'd forgotten. The chicken Kiev was nice, the fries were poor, the √©clair for dessert was so laughably small. Everything was overpriced. They have two martini cocktails - the mini Bob martini and the regular one. I had to double check they hadn't given me the mini by mistake because it was so tiny; I can only imagine the mini is a mere thimble.

For an establishment charging such hefty prices they either need to do better (improve the service and the food quality) or reduce their prices significantly. I dont recommend this place, and we won't be returning."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"This place is a true London institution. I finally visited recently on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. I had a 50% off the entire bill offer so it was the ideal time to visit.

Venue - 2 floors.

Decor - Nice, elegant, French-inspired smart brasserie. The lower-ground floor has a more opulent feel to it

Menu - Great selection. Something for everyone.

Cocktails - Very nice.

Food - Very good. The Chicken and Champagne pie was excellent, although I recommend ordering a side of mash to give the meal more balance. My partner had the Cottage Pie. It was on the small size however it tasted delicious. I opted for the whisky truffles for dessert. I was disappointed by their size as I was expecting something slightly larger although they tasted wonderful and I could really taste the whisky.

Service - Was good and attentive, even though it was slightly on the haughty side.
I did find it irritating that a waitress was cleaning cutlery and loudly dropping them into a drawer. I'm sure she didn't realise the noise it was creating, however the sound of metal clanging does not create a great atmosphere, especially when the restaurant is near-empty. It may sound like I am being overly fussy however I do think a little care and thought to the guest experience is lacking in these situations."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,Lovely lunchtime meal. Had the set menu which was the perfect size and had something for all of us. Really reasonable in terms of price for the food which meant we could splash out on the champagne! Very friendly relaxed service in a delightful art deco setting. Totally recommend for a treat.
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Our server was fabulous, I wish we had gotten his name, and the beef wellington for 2 was delicious. We enjoyed everything about our time dining here (and yes we did push the button for champagne). Highly recommend!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,1.0,"We got the ‚Äúset menu‚Äù of 3 courses. The portion sizes were a sad joke for how incredibly tiny they were. We had to order extra with the mains because the steak only came with sauce so the ‚Äúset menu‚Äù was ¬£34 plus ¬£7-8.

We ordered a Puglian wine that retails for ¬£12.50 that these charlatans were peddling for ¬£49. I ordered bread so we wouldn‚Äôt be starving when we left. The bill was a whopping ¬£203.00 with a ¬£25.00 service charge that I asked to have removed.

Maybe they should rename themselves
‚ÄúRob Rob Ricard‚Äù for how they gouge you without actually feeding you."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"A lovely experience. Reservations require $100 per person hold on credit card, but you pay the difference after the bill arrives. As long as you understand that prior, it is a great place to have an intimate upscale dining experience."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The food was incredible, one of the best places we have eaten in London, the drinks were just as great and the service was amazing. I would highly recommend anyone to visit this restaurant, we feel the money was well spent and totally worth it for the experience."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Heard this restaurant had the best Beef Wellington in town so we had to try it. Made a reservation months in advance for a bar counter top because we dined in on a Saturday night. It was quite busy and someone on the bar counter top wanted to switch to a table but it was fully reserved. We started off with some drinks a glass of wine and coca cola. Right away we ordered the Beef Wellington because we knew it was going to take 40+ minutes. The presentation of it was amazing. A beautiful golden lattice pastry. The server was nice enough to let us take a photo of it before cutting it into 2 pieces and leaving the ends on an extra plate. The best part was the sauce or gravy that it came with. It really enhanced the flavor and made the dish richer. Beef Tenderloin was cooked to perfection and all the flavors meshed well together. Very great meal and money well spent. The bartender servers were great as well, friendly people."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,Press for Champagne‚Ä¶how can one go wrong?! This lively spot is only made better by attending one of the jazz nights. Caviar service is reasonably priced and delicious and the pies are a modern twist on a British classic. Perfect opportunity to step back into days of dining gone by‚Ä¶which we should certainly bring back!
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We dined here for a joint 30th birthday celebration. As it was a special occasion we wanted an elegant and up market venue and this did not disappoint! The press for champagne buttons are great little detail and makes the dinning experience fun. The staff are very polite and professional. Service was exceptional. Between us we tried oysters, lobster macaroni cheese, and sea beam. A beautiful & elegant restaurant for a special occasion."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"I visited Bob Bob Ricard to celebrate a friend's birthday and we enjoyed everything we ordered. If your a truffle lover, the fries and mash are a must try! The chicken kyiv was so delicious, crispy on the outside and so succulent on the inside üòç However, some dishes did lack seasoning.

The interior of this restaurant is absolutely gorgeous ‚ú®The all-booth setting creates an intimate and sophisticated atmosphere. We did notice that the service was slow at times and it took a while for our food to arrive. Despite this, the unique 'Press for Champagne' button adds a fun element, making it a memorable spot for special occasions."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Top notch service and vibes. The food however has more potential, especially for that price.
Beef wellington was lacking some taste and didn‚Äôt do anything special. Service was amazing!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Absolutely worth every penny, we spent the champagne button at the table was very whimsical and does work. The service from the receptionist to the server was off the chain. The food was incredible. The Ch√¢teaubriand was amazing. Ty had the best time ever and he absolutely loved it."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"My partner has been dying to try beef wellington since I've known her, well her wish came true.

On the night we went here we'd been in London for 2 days and not impressed at all with the services of restaurants.  From breakfast places, to lunch to dinner...all were very slow to acknowledge us, bring us at least water, etc.  Maybe its a British thing but not at Bob Bob Ricard Soho!

Immediately greeted, taken to our table and then our waitress showed up in about 2 seconds, provided water and then we hit the Champagne button, and someone came within seconds.  Amazing!!!!

At this point the food could have been horrible and I would still have been happy.  But the food was amazing.  That Beef Wellington was cooked a perfect medium rare and the meat quality...OMG!  I could have eaten two of them.

The cream spinach was that perfect blend of creamy and spice, just goes so well with steak.

The steak tartare was perfect as well. Just the right amount of capers, onions and spices, loved it!

Caviar, we had the trio, highly recommended, its a nice blend of 3 different ones, well worth it.

Highly recommend reservations or you're probably not getting in.

Would I go here again?  OH HELL YAH!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Came here to celebrate an anniversary and had a wonderful experience. The atmosphere was lovely, it‚Äôs a gorgeous restaurant with a perfect setting for celebrations as a couple or with family/friends. Every item we tried from starter to dessert was of very high quality, but of course the beef wellington was the star - brilliantly prepared with wonderful flavours, tender and cooked to perfection, it is not to be missed. We returned again for a dinner with friends and the wellington and steaks were just as good as the first time, plus they provided a complementary birthday cake!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The place is stunning. Sparkling clean, is very organised and food came in time. The food is well presented. Despite not booking my dinner at the bar I had the lovely surprise because I made a new friend there. They have a nice menu with a great variety of options. The staff is very polite but could be better trained, you just need to satisfy your client. If the glass is not appropriate just swap to another one and not discuss in front of your client. Small details that could improve. I hope next time I can make clear through their website I want a normal table."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,We come here for the Instagrammable aspect and the famous ‚Äúpress for champagne‚Äù button. We will come back for the excellent food and the impeccable service.
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,We had a great holiday dinner at Bob Bob Ricard as I‚Äôm a sucker whenever beef Wellington is on a menu. Very friendly greeting and loved the all booth dining room.  Waiter helped us narrow down our wine choice and the food was outstanding. We had the caviar and tuna tartare followed by beef Wellington and mashed potatoes. Very fun evening.
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Enjoyed an early Saturday lunch. The restaurant was quiet, and we enjoyed the peace before the service got busier at standard lunch times. We enjoyed their most excellent beef Wellington, which really does live up to its reputation. There is attention paid to everything including decor, ambience, service, food, and the drink. Our server/waiter Alexandra was an excellent host, who made us feel very welcome and comfortable, but never in a fussy, or intrusive manner. The sticky toffee pudding is worth a try."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"First time here and had a fabulous time. Food was great, wine list good and well...the champagne button was a treat"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"I had the theatre menu on a Saturday afternoon, two course lunch deal for approximately ¬£30, great deal. Nice staff for lovely decor and famous press for champagne button was fun to use."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Expensive but excellent quality food, service and setting. A lovely evening meal to make you feel like you‚Äôre in the great Gatsby. If you prepared to spend over ¬£100 per person then you‚Äôll enjoy your evening without worrying about the cost. The cocktails are sublime especially with the champagne foam, and the champagne is perfectly chilled. A main each, side to share, and a dessert each was a good quantity of food for the evening."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We celebrated my birthday here, and it was an amazing and unforgettable night. The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff took exceptional care of us throughout the evening. The ambiance was stunning, making the experience even more special. We can‚Äôt wait to come back soon!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Try once..concept is cool for sure.

Caviar was good, the champagne and truffle pie too plain. Fish excellent.

Fancy place and nice booths.

Go to impress someone and have privacy of chat in the booth table as service is exceptional.

Clearly some VIPs in there and don't be shy to press the champagne button!

I would definitely go again but perhaps more for canap√©s, caviar and starters with drinks rather than a dinner.

Do dress nicely!!!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Our experience at Bob Bob Richard was truly memorable! The ambiance was cool and romantic, with gold and green decorations accented by hints of pink, setting the perfect mood for our evening. The standout was definitely the Strawberry Peach Bellini ‚Äì it was divine and I still find myself thinking about it! The creamy texture and perfect combination of strawberry and peach made it an unforgettable drink. As for the savory dishes, they were all delightful and expertly prepared. However, we would recommend skipping the bread and the signature dessert, as they were not particularly special. Nonetheless, we're eager to return and explore more of their dessert offerings next time, as we were too full to indulge further this time around. Overall, Bob Bob Richard is a must-visit for those seeking a romantic ambiance and delicious savory dishes!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Came here on a bad day, left feeling a whole lot better.
There‚Äôs something about warm food and quiet service that lifts your mood.
They didn‚Äôt try too hard, and that‚Äôs what made the experience feel real.
My order came just as I asked ‚Äî no surprises, no mistakes.
The seasoning was subtle but thoughtful, not overly salty or oily.
I noticed how the staff checked in quietly without being intrusive.
It‚Äôs now my comfort spot when I just want peace and good food."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,3.0,"Wellington in the states is better, straight up. You know it bad when the sides outshine the main food. Meat was just not seasoned at all! Only thing good was the caviar and wine. You can skip this place"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"So, famous Bob Bob Ricard. Just love this place and the food there‚ù§Ô∏è Been many times and never disappointed. The service is amazing, the design is beautiful and the food just very tasty.
They have very cozy tables, which are located in such a way that you are kind of separated from everyone. Press for champagne always works üòÖ
Would recommend to try their vareniki, with truffle and hake, that is so delicious."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"This is a lovely restaurant with service that means the ""press for more champagne"" button isn't actually needed. We were seated at the bar which was great fun. The food was really good and the cocktails even better! We arrived a little early and they accommodated us straight away. I would happily return."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Very good food, no option for any kind of fresh salad on the menu though. Very polite service, beautiful atmosphere. Should visit when in London, preferably during no busy hours because it geta a bit loud."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,1.0,"Absolutely terrible. Bumping this to ensure nobody makes the brutal mistake of eating here.

I have never had an experience this disgustingly bad. If I could sum up this restaurant it is pure instagram hype with zero substance.

The beef wellington is the supposed crown jewel of this establishment and it far missed the mark. Raw dough, poor beef quality and overpowering duxelle. Unbelievable a restaurant charging ¬£98 pound for a signature dish could serve raw dough.

The salmon en croute was similarly awful, boasting a fishy flavour due to old salmon.

The service was extremely disappointing, requiring multiple reminders to refill the glass. When asked about the Praline (nut allergy at the table) the waiter was incapable of clarifying what kind of nuts before eventually coming to the realisation that perhaps he should check with the kitchen. Despite multiple complaints. No attempt to offer even an apology. Just an empty promise to deliver the feedback to the kitchen.

The desserts were the perfect summary of the experience. Dry toffee pudding. A creme brulee that tasted of fish. I cannot fathom the absolute lack of care to be able to contaminate creme brulee with fish flavour.

The one and only gimmick of this restaurant which brings patrons to the venue is their champagne button.

If you are serious in any way about food that tastes good and service that is attentive and focused, do not dine here. It is for those who care only about posting on their social media that they eat at expensive restaurants. A Nusret experience."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"My new favorite place in London!

Gorgeous British restaurant situated in the heart of SoHo serving traditional dishes, and some old world/ Russian specialities. Chilled vodka, caviar, eggs. A million other options.

Went there especially to try the beef Wellington. It was outstanding! A number of starters also available, including oysters. Food is top notch!

Impressive wine list, including a long list of very good champagnes. Cocktails also available. The French 75 was excellent.

The interior is a gorgeous and unique art deco setting. You can‚Äôt help feeling special. Service is excellent. Helpful, charming, attentive.

Top marks! Will make this a regular place. Don‚Äôt miss out!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Wonderful lunch at Bob Bob Ricard. Excellent friendly service. Really good choice  on the menu with vegan/vegetarian options of dishes that aren‚Äôt necessarily listed as Vegan.
Lots of virgin versions of cocktails which is lovely. Had a very foamy peach and strawberry Bellini."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"My first time visiting after hearing much about Bob Bob Ricard, and I was not disappointed. I was expecting an eye watering bill, but it‚Äôs actually very easy to drink and eat extremely well here for under ¬£70 a head. Naturally, we pressed for champagne and ordered a bottle, and for the none champagne drinkers there‚Äôs a good selection of wines and cocktails. The pies were delicious, and beef Wellington divine. Will definitely be returning."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The Champagne button in the booth drew us in!
The ambiance was wonderful, with suitably attentive service by staff that seemed to care that you were having a good time.
We enjoyed the food, which was great quality and very tasty. We tried 4 different champagnes by the glass, courtesy of ‚Äúthe button‚Äù!
We will definitely be going back and taking another couple with us"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Went for the award winning beef wellington, it was really melt in your mouth beef with a good gravy to accompany, they give you a second helping on the side. It can only be ordered for two, perfect for 4 of us. Recommend to pair with spinach and fries or mash. The mood is nice and seems quite private for each table. The lighting is dim, perfect for intimate conversations. Great service up until our actual ordering, the server seemed a little moody, the rest of team were really nice to us, maybe a bad day. We went 14th December, around 5pm. Either way ignoring that, it was still good."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,1.0,"We live in Bloomsbury and we‚Äôre excited to spend our 10 year anniversary here. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. No sommelier, no attention to service, basically diner level service with Michelin starred pricing.

While Bob Bob Ricard might have had a moment in the late naughtys‚Ä¶ that moment has passed. Save your style, grace and hard earned money and go somewhere with good
Food.

This is an Instagram ‚Äúclick here for champagne‚Äù that should have been done away with years ago. Shame of you Bob Bob
Ricard.

0/5

Blah Blah Ricard."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The restaurant offered an exceptional dining experience in every aspect. From the moment you step in, the ambiance exudes class, creating an inviting atmosphere that sets the stage for an elevated culinary journey. I strongly advise making a reservation to fully immerse yourself in the fine dining experience that this establishment has to offer.

During my visit, I opted for the sea bream, and I was delighted to find that it was prepared with exquisite precision, showcasing the chef's mastery in the art of cooking. Equally impressive was my wife's choice of the Chateaubriand, which met and exceeded her expectations.

The crowning glory of our meal was the dessert‚Äîa delightful creation that not only satisfied the sweet tooth but left a lasting impression. As evident from the culinary craftsmanship, it's clear that the chef pays meticulous attention to detail.

My overall experience was so memorable that I eagerly anticipate returning for future visits. This restaurant has truly mastered the essence of fine dining, making it a must-try for anyone seeking an upscale culinary adventure."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Very good service, food was excellent and a good choice of champagne available. Will be returning"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Fine dishes and good services. I booked for a 3:30pm table on 19/10/2024 and was late to turn up at the restaurant. The receptionist lady originally could not arrange a table until late at night. However, her boss (photo attached) could manage the booking and took the initiative to help and reserve me a table at 5pm. I would express my appreciation for his kindness publicly. üôèüôèüôè"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Absolutely loved it. We celebrated my mother‚Äôs birthday here and it turned out amazing. Great service, delicious food and ambiance. Would recommend"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"The dishes were slightly lacking salt, but they remained very good. I am also unsure how house-made the pur√©e is: the texture was off.
Despite this, the meal was very enjoyable. Absolutely loved the button ""press for champagne"" next to the table."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"As we were celebrating on a Tuesday, the restaurant was a bit empty. Luckily I was offered a tour of the restaurant which I find fabulous. The decor is artsy and breathtaking and really feels like you are in the Orient Express.

We really loved the full experience and the food was amazing. They have caviar and oysters with a great wine list plus Vintage armagnac.

Once at your table you will for sure get the urge to press the champagne button which I found cool and funny.

This is a very nice place for a special occasion or to celebrate a special event since they have huge closed private rooms.

Thanks again for the great experience. :)"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Classic restaurant. Came for the ""press for champagne"" fun, and did not disappoint. Had oyster for starters, lobster Mac n cheese, and chicken & champagne pie with creme brulee to top it off.  Had a really fun date night"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Had a simply wonderful birthday party in the private room. The food was quite outstanding, the lemon sole possibly the best fish that I have eaten, the service was faultless and the staff delightful. Our guests were great too! Thank you."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"Simply fabulous place. While the food was delicious, their drinks menu is very impressive too.
Their chilled Vodka is divine.
Other notable dishes were, beef Wellington, lobster Mac & Cheese."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Our dining experience at BBR Soho was phenomenal. I enjoyed the cocktails as we shared bread, salads and the Beef Wellington. The oysters were prepared perfectly and it took me back to a childhood moment in the coast of Florida. Our celebration cake surprised my date and created a magical moment in the downstairs dining room. The elegance of the atmosphere truly enhanced our time together. Staff did everything they could to ensure the process was what the owner intended to happen. A peaceful retreat to enjoy traditional foods. What I appreciate most is the accuracy of it all. Never did I feel staff waived once to attend to requests or seem confused, given we are Americans with wild accents. We are pleased guests, already excited about our next meal at BBR! Well done! Applause for the staff and a kiss for the chefs!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Bob Bob Ricard is probably one of the best gourmet restaurants in London. Whilst it's still an expensive and posh place, it's very cozy and the atmosphere is very warm and welcoming, nothing like other similar places in Mayfair and central London.

I am not a huge fan of this type of restaurant normally but this one surprised me positively!

The food is excellent, everything we've had, from the starters to dessert was top notch and the portion sizes were decent for this type of restaurant. The staff very very courteous and friendly and even though it was a Saturday they didn't rush us out when we finished our meal and paid.

I will definitely go back and highly recommend the place. It's perfect for any occasion, whether you are a bigger group or on a date - it's ideal. There is also a funky seating area downstairs."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Really beautiful, cozy atmosphere. You are seated in a booth and each booth has a button for you to request champagne which is a nice touch. Service was impeccable. There was a slight error with part of our order, and it was fixed immediately. We had the caviar tasting with the frozen vodka shots. I‚Äôm not a huge vodka fan, but it was nice and the caviar, blini and creme fraiche were delightful.  Next we tried the seafood pelmini which was lovely.  We shared a small beef wellington which was perfectly cooked and one of the best wellingtons I have had here in London.  Sides were tasty as well.  Really enjoyed the truffle mashed potatoes and green beans. Champagne cocktails were great‚Äî especially the champagne foam on top.  We tried the Bellini and one that was more like a mojito. We also had the rose moet which was very nice. We had truffles for dessert because we were so full at that point, but the larger desserts sounded very tempting. The truffles were a perfect sweet ending without being too filling."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,4.0,"When making the booking, I noted that the dinner was for a special occasion ‚Äì a birthday. However, we were seated at one of the least desirable tables in the restaurant, and the birthday cake was brought out late.
While the restaurant setting and service were very pleasant, I was disappointed that no special effort appeared to have been made to acknowledge the occasion or enhance the overall experience.
The food was delicious."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,We went here for the Phoenician themed cocktails! Everything was exactly like it was in the movie and it was a great experience. The staff was amazing and in full character and it was just a fun night!
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,2.0,"Last weekend I was very disappointed at my visit to Bob Bob Ricard.

The food was okay, not bad but not great. For the price you pay you can visit so many other great restaurants in Soho and London more broadly.  Sides are not included so you must order some to go with your main.

The champagne list was disappointing. It was exciting to press the button and the service was great. The wait staff agreed to not top up our glasses so we could press button every time we wanted them to top us up. They came instantly and it was great novelty.

In general this place is for Instagram. The score reflects the perception vs the reality in experience. It‚Äôs novelty. For the price I paid, you could have a better experience somewhere else."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"This was our second visit to BBR soho (we have also visited BBR city & Bebe Bob) and it was just as enjoyable as the first.

From the moment you walk through the door the experience starts- the decor is amazing and sitting in a booth it feels incredibly private but there‚Äôs still a buzz in the air creating the perfect ambiance.

On every BBR we order the trio of caviar to share with our pre dinner drink as it is so delicious and also good value.

We then had a starter & main then shared a dessert-All of the food was very enjoyable.
We love the menu as it‚Äôs simple comfort food with a luxurious twist executed perfectly.

The service is discreet and champagne is topped up without me even noticing!

Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"Following a friend's enthusiastic recommendation, we dined at Bob Bob Ricard and were utterly delighted. The impeccable service began at the door with a warm coat check.
We were escorted to our table in the beautifully low-lit and elegantly decorated dining room. A delightful touch: every table is equipped with a dedicated champagne button! As champagne aficionados, we were thrilled.
We commenced with glasses of Louis Roederer Brut and their Ros√©. For our appetizer, we shared the exquisite lobster dumplings. For the main course, we indulged in Beef Wellington accompanied by creamy mashed potatoes and tender spinach, all expertly paired with a 2009 Margaux. Our server informed us that the restaurant maintains a reasonable 75% markup on wines, allowing guests to explore exceptional vintages that might otherwise be prohibitively expensive (typical markups often exceed 300%).
To conclude, we savored a dramatic presentation of flaming cr√®me br√ªl√©e, paired with a renowned Sauternes and a South African wine.
From the moment we arrived at the final bite, Bob Bob Ricard was an unforgettable culinary experience. A must-visit for any discerning foodie."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"We had an amazing dining experience, the staff were incredibly attentive. The food was absolutely fantastic, so delicious. We will definitely be coming again!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"A very fun place for a special occasion. The ""press for champagne"" button works as advertised! Excellent, attentive service. Quiet, classy atmosphere. The food was also very good, although our options were limited as one of us has a prawn allergy. Can't wait to go back and press the button again!"
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"The food was amazing. I definitely recommend the beef wellington, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. The desserts looked great and tasted great! The staff were the right amount of attentive, and the best part is that at the table there is a button to press for more champagne."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"This restaurant is housed in a charming venue steeped in history. The service here is top-notch, with attentive staff who make you feel truly welcome. Additionally, they offer an impressive selection of champagnes at very reasonable prices."
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,Had the most amazing lunch. Beef wellington was something special and I would definitely go back and order it again. Also i had the oyster and caviar for starter
Bob Bob Ricard Soho,5.0,"It was an amazing dinner. They took care of every detail and the recommendations from our waiter (Manuel) were so good. The quality of food is great. We will come back again, for sure."
St. John,5.0,"This is unpretentious excellence. In a world where TikTok hype drives crowds, St. John just focuses on doing things right (boring done right).

It is a classic British spot, known for its nose-to-tail approach. Service was polite and professional without being fussy. We never felt rushed and never felt ignored.

The fish of the day was excellent, and of course we had the bone marrow on toast, which was worth the visit on its own. Flavours are not experimental, but the quality and freshness make everything great. I had the pigeon, which I really enjoyed, although the meat is firmer and the flavour stronger than other meats, so it may not be for everyone.

Right outside is a more casual bar with a lighter atmosphere where you can have a drink and snack on excellent food without spending much."
St. John,5.0,"Perfect for people who want good cooking with adventurous options! Got a drink at the bar as I arrived a little early, house wine was great. Our waitress was wonderful, and spent extra time recommending dishes for us. I got the Pig and Ox Liver, both of which were amazing. The madeleines cannot be missed, I would go for them over a regular dessert. Easy recommendation, get a reservation early!"
St. John,5.0,"This is by far the best British restaurant I‚Äôve ever had in my whole life. I‚Äôve come to UK for two weeks and nothing of what I‚Äôve tried so far can be compared to this restaurant. From the starters, to the mains, to the desserts. It‚Äôs just ‚Äúmmm‚Äù ü•∞üòò. So good, so delicious!

Glad that I came here during my time in the UK. Would love to pay this place a visit again üôè"
St. John,5.0,"What a special restaurant! Really enjoyed the inventive British menu, every dish was unique and thoughtful, without being pretentious. Fun to try some more unusual cuts of meat. Great drinks list and the bread pudding dessert was incredible. Service was extremely thoughtful and attentive, and helpful with dietaries. Wonderful experience and I look forward to our next visit!"
St. John,5.0,"St. John Smithfield was an absolutely wonderful and totally unique experience that totally lived up to expectations.
The food was excellent and very unique. We had the Hake and Ox Liver for our mains, the Bone Marrow for our appetizer, and Plum Tart (not quite sure if that‚Äôs the name) for dessert. Most of these you would struggle to find elsewhere but was nevertheless brilliant.
The service was unpretentious and attentive. No complaints other than maybe a very slight ‚Äúcoldness‚Äù.
The atmosphere was difficult to rate because it really doesn‚Äôt have much going for it. It‚Äôs rustic yet very simplistic and really doesn‚Äôt distract from the food, which I appreciate.
In conclusion, St. John was an excellent restaurant that certainly lives up to the hype and I can understand why it was supposedly Anthony Bourdain‚Äôs favorite restaurant in London."
St. John,5.0,"Very much enjoyed this visit.   The room had a great vibe.  The service is very friendly, and the food was fantastic.   We had a large group and had almost one of everything and it was all good.  Some weird stuff like chicken neck and lamb liver but all of was excellent.   The smell and taste of the fresh Madeleines at the end were simply awesome.  I will be back on future London visits."
St. John,5.0,"Attentive service.  Food was great.  Bone marrow tasted great but very little substance.  The butter was nice.  Madeleines was perfect.

Ambience a bit plain and run down.  Feels not so clean."
St. John,5.0,"This restaurant is truly one of a kind ‚Äî the atmosphere, the setting, and the character make it stand out. The quality of the food is consistently outstanding. Special mention to the bone marrow, which has remained unchanged over time, and to the impeccable, almost clinical-level service we‚Äôve received on each visit.
We‚Äôll keep coming back on every future trip to London.

Can‚Äôt wait to return and end another joyful meal with the best madeleines in the UK!"
St. John,2.0,"We stopped here for lunch while exploring England, drawn in by the restaurant‚Äôs strong reputation. Our group ordered a wide range of dishes‚Äîfrom tripe to a simple roast chicken‚Äîbut unfortunately, none of them left much of an impression. My roast chicken, in particular, was disappointing: moist but bland, and honestly not as good as what my mom makes at home. Surprisingly, the appetizers were more enjoyable than the mains, which helped salvage the experience a bit. Overall, we left feeling underwhelmed and less enthusiastic about exploring British cuisine‚Äîunless it‚Äôs the classic fish and chips."
St. John,5.0,"I recently shot the reception of a lovely wedding at St John. It was incredible! What a wonderful venue, amazing staff and the food was next level. Can thoroughly recommend to any couple looking for the right venue in London, St John is the one."
St. John,5.0,"First time visit at the ‚ÄúOG‚Äù st.johns at smithfield. Everything went smoothly and we had an amazing time - From the atmosphere, to the service and the incredible food. You can sense how well the whole concept is planned and that the passion translates onto the plates. All the dishes that we ordered delivered, especially the duck and roast bone marrow were amazing. Local produce never fails to disappoint. Will definitely come again as they do change menu items frequently."
St. John,5.0,"Love this place. I‚Äôd advise sitting in the bar and ordering small plates. Restaurant also brilliant but I love a low key relaxed vibe. Menu changes daily but loads of great, interesting options."
St. John,5.0,"I was recommended St John‚Äôs, and it absolutely lived up to expectations. The space is interesting, with the bar area set in what looks like an old smokehouse, adding a bit of character. The restaurant itself is clean, white, and minimal, with a rustic touch that ties everything together. It‚Äôs simple but works well.

One of the standout features is the in-house bakery, which seems to handle all the desserts, and they do an incredible job.

The service was excellent. My server Callum was fantastic‚Äîfriendly, helpful with the menu, and went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect. He even spoke to head chef John, who then came out for a chat, which was a really nice surprise and made the night even more special.

The food itself was outstanding. Every dish was top quality, perfectly executed, and full of flavor. It‚Äôs clear why St John‚Äôs has a Michelin star and has kept it.

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for incredible food in a relaxed and unpretentious setting. It‚Äôs well worth a visit!"
St. John,5.0,"I was there for an invited dinner through a scientific event. The food was excellent and my options were all vegan. We had very good wine and food overall and the service and staff were friendly, fast, and particularly welcoming. Of course the atmosphere is very nice considering the old grounds and the nice architecture."
St. John,3.0,"Service was great and it was good to experience some authentic style British cooking. Unfortunately the food was not as good as expected for the price and hype. There wasn't much to eat in the bone marrow and half of the lamb was just fat. At best bib gourmand, no way this place is Michelin 1 star."
St. John,5.0,"Absolutely stunning restaurant! I was here recently and had some of the most fantastic food.

Firstly we were pleasantly greeted by a lovely gentleman (didn‚Äôt catch his name but he was super chatty and lovely). And we were seated right by the kitchen which was perfect! Loved seeing the chefs work, one of them was butchering a whole pig at one point - incredible!

The food was an easy 10/10. The bone marrow was easily the best dish we had, it‚Äôs obvious why they run out of this so quickly. The pork head and broth was so rich and delicious and we loved the lamb and the blood cake too. And how could I forget the Welsh rarebit. So rich and delicious. I want this again! And I‚Äôd go back just to have the bone marrow again and again.

Highly recommended."
St. John,5.0,Amazing spot. Food was awesome and the staff was Very kind. They even got us the bread on a take away box cause ouro baby loved It.
St. John,5.0,"Hands down this was a top 3 food experience of our life. The food was simply delicious and this is what matters in the end. Big thumbs up to Anthony, the aussie waiter who took care of us."
St. John,4.0,"In a room of white so still,
Where linens drape and time stands still,
Plates arrive, a work of art,
Each a feast, a perfect start.

The menu shifts with each new day,
Check ahead, don‚Äôt lose your way.
The staff will guide if you‚Äôre unsure,
A dining haven, calm and pure.

For six we booked, a lucky find,
Weeks ahead, the stars aligned.
Crab and herring, bright and bold,
Flavors fresh and stories told.

Gurnard, golden, placed with care,
Pork cheek rich beyond compare.
Greens and potatoes on the side,
Simple joys that none denied.

Then dessert‚Äîa final cheer,
Honeycomb and sponge appear.
Sticky, sweet, and deeply spun,
Every bite a perfect one.

Steep the price, but worth it all,
A meal to hold, a night to call.
For here, the food alone will shine,
A masterpiece in every line."
St. John,5.0,It's a vibe. Not fine dining but gives you the sense that you're about to witness something special. People in regular clothes going but having a delicious and well crafted meal
St. John,3.0,"A disappointing visit to what had been one of our favorite restaurants. The quality of the food at St. John has always been the foundation of our love for the institution, but it feels as though there isn‚Äôt the same care for the preparation as there has been in the past. The bone marrow was remarkably dry. The other dishes lacked any flavor. The only saving graces were the Welsh rarebit and the lemon tart."
St. John,2.0,"Incredibly underwhelming place.

The food is decent, and actually tastes quite alright if you don't go for crazy options, but the dining room felt very uncomfortable for me. It is trying to be rustic and authentic, but just looks bad. It was loud, the constant buzzing of (I guess) old fluorescent lightbulbs was getting on my nerves, I got shouted at by a server when I accidentally stumbled to the entrance of the room instead of a polite ""Excuse me"".

I have been to a lot of restaurants in London, from Delaunay and Fazenda to various pubs and kebab shops, and this is the most uncomfortable I have ever felt, with the least appetizing food ever.

If you want British food, skip this place, go to a pub, and then somewhere for the afternoon tea for the price of dining here.

The desserts were lovely though, and tasted great, but it's not saving the overall experience."
St. John,2.0,Can only edit to update for this year's experience.  Unfortunately was nothing like our first visit last year.  The quality of the food was down considerably and service less attentive.  Definitely a disappointing visit and unlikely to come again the next time we are in London
St. John,5.0,"I enjoyed our meal at St. John. We ordered the squid, fennel and aioli and brown crab meat for starters and they were lovely. We had the trotter pie for our main to share. It was nice and very filling. We also had the welsh rarebit to come with our main, but it was a bit disappointing since the bread was a bit burned and hard."
St. John,5.0,Great experience .. incredible and interesting take on their dishes.   Impecable service !! Lots of Fun and super good food
St. John,5.0,"I'm giving this 5 stars overall as the experience and concept were bit spot on. Great service, flexible when we decided to eat further mains and knowledgeable when it came to drinks. The food was not very precisely cooked/prepared (liver over, bacon dry without being crispy ,mussel salad watery) but they were quite busy. Overall 100% recommended. Treat yourself to the Madeline's - ethereal üòç"
St. John,5.0,"The restaurant of my dreams. Had wanted to go for ages with my partner and our visit did not disappoint in the slightest.

Staff were friendly and attentive, without being overbearing and really made us feel at ease. There is an old school charm to proceedings, without ever feeling stuffy or exclusionary.

The atmosphere is relaxed, and the light, airy dining room cultivates a lovely buzz.

The food was everything I'd hoped for. Rustic, traditional, comforting and incredibly satisfying. Our favourite dishes were the smoked cod's roe, sweetbreads, and the Eccles cake, but everything was done masterfully. Even a simple bowl of spring greens tossed in butter and a little bit of broth were a delight. Please be aware, this is not for the tweezers and foam crew; it is nose to tail cooking, with the focus being on the ingredients, not avant garde presentation.

All in all, a fantastic lunch and I can't wait to return"
St. John,5.0,We enjoyed a relaxed and very tasty Monday lunch at the end of a long weekend in town. We've been here before and the constantly changing menu didn't disappoint. Attentive service in a busy dining area that was arranged to provide atmosphere without overcrowding.
St. John,5.0,"One of my favourite restaurants in the world and one of the best arguments for British food I've ever experienced. The staff were incredible, the perfect balance of attentiveness and leaving you to enjoy your food and company. They also advise on how much we should order (they actually suggested that we ordered too many side dishes) as well as wines to pair well with different dishes.

The food itself was, as you would expect, exceptional. The famous Bone Marrow exceeded the hype, we had Pigeon and Sole which were beautifully cooked with the perfect accompaniments. This place has made me wish Welsh Rarebit was available as a side in every restaurant. The meal overall was very good value for money considering the amount and quality of what we ate.

Absolutely looking forward to going back at the soonest opportunity."
St. John,5.0,"I really enjoyed here- it was a lovely dinner.

Gluten free chocolate cake is a must if you ask me. Roasted bone marrow was good but I would try other items on my next visit.

There were a couple of highlights. The wine with honey and almond flavor - the gluten free chocolate cake and the lamb dish (it was rich but super tasty)."
St. John,4.0,"Went for a Wednesday night dinner and service was amazing! Our waiter was very friendly

The bone marrow & sardines were delicious - but the braised beef was slightly too chewy for my liking. The rest of the food was ok. Pavlova for dessert was the best!"
St. John,3.0,"The food was simply sad looking. I do acknowledge St John‚Äôs impact on the fine dining world, but the food was just not‚Ä¶ hitting. The flavours and textures were very understated and frankly, not great. We paid ¬£28 for a crab dish that we had to deshell ourselves and we barely got any meat out of it. We also spotted a mouse on the way to the toilets. Not worth the hype in my opinion. Thankfully, the meal was fairly cheap."
St. John,5.0,"Coffee, Gurnard, bread, mussels and ginger cake are all good, also the service was good as well."
St. John,5.0,"Came for lunch on a Friday, the restaurant and bar area were both busy.

The food was excellent, with the standouts being the bone marrow starter and honeycomb ice cream for dessert.

The service was friendly without being overbearing. Prices were reasonable given the quality of food

Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
St. John,5.0,"Fantastic meal and exceptional service from a London institution. Quality British fare at its finest - great ingredients and smart twists on dishes classic and modern.
Rustic settings and attentive wait staff. Massive wine & drinks list as well to complement the food."
St. John,5.0,"I would recommend coming here. The service and food are great. I had the venison broth and (special) hare saddle which were both fantastic. Is very difficult to get reservations here, and I can see why."
St. John,5.0,"Absolutely wonderful, one of the best meals I have ever had with lovely staff who were very helpful and clearly very passionate about the food.

We went for lunch and found the place to be very unpretentious, it's a place where they let the food shine and stand on the quality of the food.

It was an open kitchen and getting to watch the chef was really fantastic.

Our group of three had three different dishes, one beef, one with pigs cheek and one with pork belly and trotters, all of them were just wonderful.

The green salad as a side was incredibly simple but somehow had such an amazing depth of flavour and the Welsh rarebit was unreal.

The dessert menu is very extensive and the date loaf with butterscotch sauce was the best dessert my Mum has ever had while the Madeleines were absolutely incredible, so simple but so good.

I also thought for the equality of the food and service the price was very reasonable for a special meal."
St. John,3.0,"While we enjoyed going out for dinner, this restaurant sadly is not worth it for the price you pay in our opinion. We were disappointed firstly with the presentation of the food, very little thought gone in when you are spending ¬£15 - ¬£30 a plate. Across all dishes we found them either to be too salty or sweet and the sauce with the rabbit was watery and lacking in flavour. All in all the balance was off in all dishes in our opinion and for what you are spending you get far better elsewhere. On the plus side our waiter was lovely, and the venue while not to our taste was unique, but sadly we won‚Äôt be rushing back."
St. John,4.0,"I was lucky enough to get a last-minute booking for their 30th anniversary menu. This restaurant had been on my radar for several years but it was the promotion that finally made try it.

I had the famous bone marrow but I have had better bone marrow elsewhere. In my opinion the green salad with parsley, capers and dressing overpowers the flavour of the bone marrow, and it should be served with something else.

I ordered two mains, the skate with tomato and aioli and a lamb chop that replaced the roast Mangalitza that they ran out of. I was served both mains at once, which made me a bit stressed about food getting cold. I would have preferred having those served staggered and I am guessing service did not warn the kitchen.

The skate was very well cooked and balanced and the combination with the juicy tomatoes and aioli worked perfectly. The lamb roast on the other hand was lukewarm and although it was tasty and tender it was not as interesting.

For dessert I ordered the lemon posset and the Eccle Cake with Lancashire cheese. I was indifferent to the former, and pleasantly surprised with the latter. The pairing with the cheese works really well and I enjoyed it a lot. I ordered 6 madeleines to go that came right out of the oven, which is something I really appreciated and should be encouraged in bakeries.

Other than the fault with the main dishes the service was very attentive and kind. The ambiance of the place is relaxed and also formal, which I really loved.

St. John is a staple in London and it is a must-try. The anniversary promotion made the meal more special and enjoyable , but I am not sure I would have been so happy to pay the full price for all those dishes which could have easily been over ¬£100. However, overall I really liked the variety and quality of their menu and I will definitely come back."
St. John,5.0,"I had high expectations and somehow they were exceeded. I think about the bone-marrow and sardines daily - they were incredible. The weakest part of the dish was the Welsh rarebit - I found it flat. Despite the lamb being very good, I felt something was missing. However, the Ox heart and chicory was delicious and opened me to how good heart can be when cooked very well. If you are going to get any desert - get the blood orange cake. I don‚Äôt like sugary things  - but it was the best cake I have ever had. Perfect balance of sweet and tart."
St. John,5.0,"Wow ü§Ø if you haven‚Äôt been to St. John‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ what are you doing??!?! I can‚Äôt believe this was my first time here and my 1000th time in London, I will definitely be making this a regular. Was quite easy to get an early reservation for lunch. Really enjoyed the concept and overall food experience. The servers were so knowledgeable and are really proud of the animal sources and overall restaurant 10/10."
St. John,5.0,"The legend lives on. Delicious food in a stripped down, no fuss no frills kind of place that becomes almost charming because of the great food and staff. It's not a usual occasion nor sight, to walk in and find a world renowned chef sitting at a table dining with friends. If this happens 9 out of 10 times you know you're in for a treat. And it was, my only regret is not to have shown up starving so I could try more items. If I have one complaint it would be the stemware, although charming and quirky, the wine list has some gems and I feel like they deserve some elevated glassware, but then again it adds to the charm and ethos of the no fuss no frills experience, its all about enjoying and sharing great food with great people."
St. John,5.0,"This is one of the must-try restaurants in London. The restaurant can be described as: ""no fuss, just a properly cooked food"".

Their menu always changes, with dishes constantly on rotation, and the only thing that stays consistent is Quality. Everything we had was on a different scale of ""good"". From simple ""that's good"" to ""this is the best meal I've had in a while""

Cannot recommend this place enough, either for dinner or lunch.

The only downside - the reception in the restaurant is quite poor, so you may need to get in and out if you need access to the internet."
St. John,5.0,"Visited in May during a quick London getaway.
Everything was phenomenal.
I understand they change the menu seasonally so I won‚Äôt list what I had.

They take pride in their culinary art and it definitely shows.
We took the last dinner reservation yet staff were patient with us"
St. John,5.0,Travelled from Thailand to this legendary establishment in 2022. I'm a big fan of Anthony Bourdain's No reservation and this place is on my bucket list. The staffs were lovely and the food was execptional. Simple yet elegance no frills British cuisine. Highly recommended.
St. John,5.0,"Second visit this year and it was as good as the first time.  I'd pass on the famous bone marrow starter next time - it's hit and miss as to whether you actually get any marrow but what you do get is delicious.  The potted beef was as great as I remember it.
Pheasant and Trotter pie was excellent as was the Hake and the Welsh Rarebit.  All washed down with a bottle of St John Macon. Finished with fresh madeleines and a Fergroni.  If you're used to overly attentive service then dont expect that here.  The service is good but a few more smiles would not go amiss.  We'll be back next time we're in London."
St. John,1.0,"My horrible experience at this restaurant has prompted to write my first google review. It baffles me that an establishment like this has a Michelin star as well as relatively good reviews. It‚Äôs made me question my sanity really. I was so excited to dine here because of its Michelin star rating, Anthony Bourdain‚Äôs high praise, and overall good reviews. However, I was severely disappointed. My review is due to the poor service and subpar food.

St. John has an almost all-white interior. The ambience (or lack of) feels like you're in a mental asylum and sterile.

Service: When we sat down, we were served bread and butter right away but were not provided bread plates. Our server knew of this as she saw that we had to rest our butter knives in the bread basket, yet she did nothing about it. Our server did not take the time to run us through a menu that, perhaps due to not being familiar with British cuisine, we did not know half of what was on there. Throughout the meal we were not asked if we were enjoying the meal once and it almost felt like our table was forgotten about. One experience that really tainted the experience was when one of the busy boys placed our appetizers on our table without saying a word, looked at us, and then walked away. This same bus boy was seen touching his phone and then touching the tops of the utensils he was supposed to clean. Ironically there are signs in the dining room that mention to not have your phones out.

Food: On top of the service, what truly made this experience horrible was having to pay for overpriced mediocre at best food. This part again really confuses me because everyone seems to like the food here but truly I would not pay for this food at all. We ordered the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù bone marrow and pig ear dish. The bone marrow was nothing special and the parsley ‚Äúsalad‚Äù was more like a garnish than a salad. Maybe we were served smaller bones or were just not competent in taking the bone marrow out of the bones but I don't think the bone marrow we got even amount to a tablespoon. The pig ear tasted like nothing and the salad was overdressed and way too oily.

For our entrees, we ordered the ox tail and the eel. While the oxtail was cooked nicely, you could find better mash at any non-michelin star restaurant. Overall the oxtail was not worth the price. The eel was way too salty, too small of a portion for the price, and its runner beans were watery and just basically steamed vegetables with horseradish thrown on top.

We were going to order their medeleines but the idea of waiting 15 more minutes for mediocre overpriced food at this restaurant was unbearable. Overall, the restaurant felt as if it was trying too hard and yet did not deliver on anything. Save your money and try all the other restaurants London has to offer."
St. John,4.0,Very authentic feeling British spot! The food was overall not that great in our opinion except for the bone marrow which was pretty good and the madeleins which were absolutely delicious. Service was perfect and very friendly.
St. John,5.0,"St. John was definitely a unique experience. The service was great, all of the staff were lovely and attentive. The pickled mackerel were a standout for us - unreal don‚Äôt sleep on it! If it is available get it - trust. The artichokes were also great and so was the bone marrow of course. We tried the devilled kidneys on toast - these were very rich definitely had a particular taste (we were warned they weren‚Äôt for everyone) but don‚Äôt have regrets about trying them! Only suggestion for these would be to get a side to soak up the sauce or balance the dish more. We got a side of the greens but the dressing was a bit heavy. Side note the St. John Pinot Noir was actually very good as well.

Overall it was a memorable experience and we would definitely come back!"
St. John,5.0,St John not only has some of the most reasonably priced cocktails I have had in London so far but also some of the most delicious food as well! I enjoyed their snails and John dory whilst my partner enjoyed their goats curd and tomatoes. We left feeling very satisfied with our meal and will definitely be returning.
St. John,5.0,"Outstanding food, glorious menu. Everything cooked using local, market fresh ingredients. Great wine list too. Everything is so  good, so it's difficult to single one dish. If you get the chance, go, don't hesitate."
St. John,4.0,"I can see why this was one of Bourdain's favorites (if not his favorites). Paper tablecloths, simple decor on the top of a normal bar. The atmosphere is fun, and casual and light. No pretentiousness.

Food was good, but in my humble opinion (I am not a Michelin reviewer, just a schmuck on the internet) it's not one star worthy. If I'm being extremely picky, the bread I believe was over-toasted (it was sharp to the point it was cutting into the roof of my mouth). One of my marrow bones had hardly anything in it. In addition, I believe that the Lamb's Liver was also underseasoned but that may just be my salt-crazed American pallette.

In terms of highlights, the Madelines are a must try, they are served hot and fresh and are a real treat. Also the chips with the Lamb's Liver were the best I had during my stay.

Staff was friendly and kind. They were very very busy for a Monday so I was dining for a while, but they were extremely helpful."
St. John,5.0,"My mom and I had an incredible lunch here. After hearing so many recommend St. John‚Äôs, we were very excited. Although the food was amazing, what really made the meal special was our waiter, Oz. He was kind enough to walk us through the menu, ask us about ourselves, and provided amazing service. He recommended we try the bone marrow, poached skate, welsh rarebit, crispy pig skin, and ox heart (special). I loved the bone marrow and the ox heart. The bone marrow on top the sourdough with the parsley was very rich, but also refreshing because of the parsley. The ox heart was lean, but surprisingly quite tender and full of flavor. I ate it with the horseradish that it came with and wow, what a bite (a somewhat painful one haha). For dessert, Oz recommended the ginger loaf and butterscotch sauce, and of course the madeleines. The ginger-loaf was AMAZING. It wasn‚Äôt overly sweet, and was so moist and I could eat it for every meal. I would recommend getting a cup of earl gray to drink with it. As for the madeleines, they were warm and light, and oh so delicious. We will definitely return to St. John‚Äôs on our next visit to London."
St. John,5.0,"Oh my goodness, what an amazing place! The food is exceptional - made by a team that really understands and love flavour. The service team are really knowledgeable and helpful and the atmosphere is really unusual - austere but somehow really welcoming"
St. John,5.0,"Amazing food, and service.  Marrow Bone, Pig Skin and Madelines are amazing"
St. John,5.0,"Really nice place. Very good service, somewhat casual and delicious food from the less common ingredients (tripes, bone marrow, pork skin, brain, snails etc). Strong wine selection."
St. John,4.0,"Wonderful lunch, some hits and misses but generally the food is good.

Since they are a bakery I‚Äôd have expected bread to be warm when they serve but it wasn‚Äôt.

Sauces for salad are repeat in different dishes

Must book ahead as they seem to be quite popular."
St. John,5.0,"Great and authentic English cuisine, worth every penny you spend"
St. John,5.0,"A very nice dining area with white-washed decor and professional staff. Although a bit noisy the day we went due to a large group gathering, it was difficult to hear each other while talking. Nevertheless, I liked the seating and the food options. The fish was great, simply out of this world, cooked to perfection. We also enjoyed our braised lamb, and yes, the sardines were grilled with mastery.

Will try bone marrow and ox liver some other day.

and yeah they have some good cocktails."
St. John,5.0,"We arrived on a Tuesday for lunch. It was packed but we had a reservation.
We started with some bread and butter and then moved on to the bone marrow with parsley salad. It was very good but beware: you‚Äôll spill food on your clothes! Very tasty ox tongue with beetroot and horseradish. We also had the grilled lamb heart which was amazing and surprising.
There was an interesting day special: greens and pig cheeks.
St John has a wonderful service. The vibe is great and relaxed, many tables seemed to be having a great time. You can either visit for a serious elegant work meeting, a birthday party or just an unexpected informal lunch."
St. John,2.0,"To be honest this was kind of crap. I know it‚Äôs billed as nose to tail but you hope for something in between. All the options were ear, brain and trotter and there is a reason most of those are not on other menus. I‚Äôm happy with tripe if I can also have something that isn‚Äôt an offcut. Service and atmosphere were grand but the food was gross."
St. John,5.0,Went there with my friends and we have ordered a whole roast pig to share among all of us. The meat was so tender and delectable. Langoustine was finger-licking good. Absolutely dig the profiteroles.
St. John,4.0,"Friendly staff and fun atmosphere. The food was OK, a lot of fatty foods but I guess that's part of the cuisine. Makeral was excellent"
St. John,5.0,"I went to this restaurant about a year ago and forgot to give a review. Highly recommend for excellent British cuisine and often a creative twist to the dishes.
The interior is minimalist and quite bare, not my preference and can get a little loud sometimes. But a very good restaurant and worth making the effort to visit."
St. John,3.0,"Supposed to be one of the most well known and iconic restaurants on our Food Crawl dining venue list. This Michelin 1*,‚Äò nose-to-tail ‚Äò eatery, belonging to the legendary English chef Fergus Henderson, sadly turned out to be our trip‚Äôs only culinary disappointment!

Made famous and put on the foodie map by Anthony Bourdain. He called this institution his ‚Äòdream restaurant‚Äò in one of his ‚ÄòNo Reservation‚Äò episodes, praising the ‚Äòcomplete package‚Äò the restaurant has to offer. At that time, Henderson‚Äôs emblematic, simple and yet utterly delicious ‚Äò Roasted Bone Marrow with sea salt and Parsley Salad ‚Äò dish was just being unearthed by the culinary world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶resulting in chefs all over trying to emulate it and putting similar renditions on their menus.

We are by no means pointing fingers at our ordered food and giving them a ‚Äò thumbs-down ‚Äò. Some of our choices, at least components of them, indeed tasted pretty good. However, based on the restaurant‚Äôs reputation and modus operandi of ‚Äòless is more‚Äò and using a maximum of only 3 - 4 ingredients/components per dish. It is therefore expected that due to this simple and straightforward approach, the top-notched ingredients will be treated lovingly and prepared perfectly with skill and care. Sadly this was not the case. Our grilled Ox-Heart mains, for example, were over-cooked, dry and tough and accompanied by a bland, one dimensional, uninspirational sauce/jus.

Accompanying side dishes and salads followed a similarly sad pattern and result. Identical to some Indian restaurants‚Äô approach of using a generic ‚Äòmother sauce‚Äò eir curry base. St John's mirrors a similar mannerism with their dressing. During our visit, a monotonous Horseradish/Sour cream base concoction was broadly applied and used. Be it for our Veal tongue salad, the Ox-heart side dish or the side complement to our roasted Pheasant main! Where is the creativity usually found in Michelin star establishments?

However, there were certain stand-out dishes worthy of mentioning. The deeply flavourful Beef Broth, with ingredients similar to the traditional Scotch broth, but using beef instead of lamb, was a definite winner. The well seasoned, juicy and moist Pheasant dish is another thumbs-up dish‚Ä¶... .possibly one of the best tasting poultry dishes I have recently come across! Lastly, the Blood Orange Eton Mess dessert was absolutely out-of-this-world delectable! The Pear and Almond cake was pretty fine too.

Our lady server was most friendly, helpful and attentive, adding a crucial positive element to our dining experience!

In conclusion, a fine example of‚Ä¶.‚Äù You win some, You lose some! ‚Äú"
St. John,4.0,"St John, the establishment that triggered a British culinary revolution has still got ‚Äúit‚Äù! Getting a table at a convenient time can be challenging but it‚Äôs worth the effort. The barebones dining room looks like an East London workhouse given a moderate makeover, and the food is very British Beige, but tasty. The classic bone marrow on toast is great, and I can recommend the faggots and mash. The lemon posset was a bit underwhelming, or else it would have been a 5 star experience. Great selection of wines, though a few more options by the glass would have been nice.  Service was friendly and efficient."
St. John,5.0,"It was my third time here over several years and I wasn't disappointed. Consistency is not easy when you've been running for such a long time but somehow the St. John's crew have not only survived 2 years of pandemic but also kept the high quality standards their customers where and are used to. Ingredients and service where absolutely on point. I will single out the calf's liver, cooked to absolute perfection. Thank you"
St. John,5.0,"A perfect meal. Elevated, comforting flavours using great produce treated with care and not overfussed. The brill special of the day was exceptional as well as the date loaf with butterscotch sauce. Staff were helpful and friendly and the vibe of the restaurant is welcoming and tasteful. Highly recommend."
St. John,4.0,"We had the pleasure of ordering the Halibut and the Pork, both of which were exquisite. The Halibut was cooked to perfection, adorned with a beautiful sauce and accompanied by delectable sides that complemented the fish wonderfully. The Pork was tender and succulent, with a crispy skin that added a satisfying texture to the dish. However, the skin was a bit challenging to cut and bite through, which slightly detracted from the overall experience.

To accompany our main courses, we ordered additional greens and a salad, both of which exceeded our expectations. The cooked greens were expertly seasoned, likely with a rich ingredient such as butter, elevating the dish to new heights. The salad was a refreshing and well-balanced mix, with a delightful citrusy dressing that tied all the components together harmoniously."
St. John,5.0,"Amazing meal at St. John‚Äôs in London! Each dish was bursting with flavour and cooked to perfection. The staff were warm and friendly, creating a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere. The roast lamb, John Dory and house wine were particular highlights. It easily ranks among my top five restaurants in the world, and I can‚Äôt wait to return!"
St. John,5.0,"Best to make a reservation as the restaurant fills up by about 1pm, although you can still sit in the bakery area. The bone marrow is definitely something to order, and the turbot fish is really good too. The rarebit was a little heavy with the rest of the meal but it‚Äôs a good one. The pig‚Äôs tongue was something many tables ordered and worth a try too."
St. John,4.0,"Good was delicious, service was prompt and friendly. I don‚Äôt know how they do it, but I love the way they did their greens. The beetroot was juicy and sweet. Pea mash was heavenly. They also have special menus for the day, would have loved to tried their eel pie. Portion looks huge.

Note that there‚Äôs an outdoor bakery and a dining restaurant on the inside. Honestly would go back for the dining and tried out their bakes and coffee if back again. Honestly price wise I think it‚Äôs reasonable in relation to the food portion."
St. John,5.0,"Amazing experience, the food was incredible and so well thought out, not like anywhere else you can eat in London. For such a high end place, it did not have a snooty atmosphere, it wasn‚Äôt bad prices and the staff were so lovely.

My husband and I started off with the bone marrow, razor clams and potted beef, all of which were incredible. We then had the crispy pork cheek, which was very rich but tasty, and kid kidneys which were divine. We then finished off with a very generous portion of treacle dessert. Paired with their house red which was delicious!

I couldn‚Äôt recommend enough, probably the best meal I have ever had!"
St. John,5.0,Absolutely great experience. They definitely  are very clever in appreciation of not just the outside but the inside of the school. Must try bone marrow and parsley. Definitely get some fresh Madeleines baked. Make sure you book ASAP.
St. John,5.0,"Proper good food from start to finish. We started with the venison and mackerel, our friends had the house classic bone marrow on toast. Then we shared the mega meat pie, hake, with sides of potatoes and greens, and Welsh rarebit. Phenomenal. Super friendly servers and a very non-fussy interior. Would highly recommend."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We had an amazing evening at Faros in London! The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äî the truffle pasta was rich, creamy, and packed with flavor, easily one of the best we‚Äôve ever had. The ravioli were equally impressive, perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. You can really taste the quality of the ingredients and the care put into each dish.

The drinks were also a highlight of the evening ‚Äî creative, well-balanced, and served with style. The atmosphere was warm and vibrant, and the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive without being overbearing.

Faros exceeded our expectations in every way. We‚Äôll definitely be back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience in London!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The atmosphere and the food were great. I especially recommend trying the risotto. The staff were warm and attentive, making us feel at home. Everyone was lovely, but with Ruby it felt like we had known each other for years. I can definitely recommend Faros with peace of mindüòç"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"5‚òÖ ‚Äì A great experience from A to Z!

Faros Restaurant is the perfect place if you are looking for excellent food, friendly service and a beautiful interior. The food was exceptionally tasty ‚Äì fresh ingredients, perfectly seasoned and beautifully presented.

The staff were very nice, professional and always smiling. The whole lunch went without a single mistake. The atmosphere is stylish yet cozy ‚Äì ideal for lunch with a partner or with friends.

I definitely recommend Faros to anyone who wants to enjoy great cuisine in the center of London. I will definitely be back!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Traditional Italian cuisine. The pizza is made exactly right, with thin crust and soft cheese melting in your mouth, the pepperoni is good quality with strong flavor. The service is also impeccable- Ruby is very attentive. The atmosphere is cozy and nostalgic with good sound tracks in the background. We will definitely come back again."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We had a lovely family dinner at Faros London this evening. Although there was a small issue during the meal, it was quickly addressed by the management in a professional and efficient manner. I truly appreciate how responsive and helpful the team was.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the overall service was great. Special thanks to the management and staff for turning things around so smoothly and making our family gathering a pleasant experience."
Faros Oxford Circus,2.0,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the experience at Faros. Me and my partner visited on a weekday lunch since it had a very high rating, and we wanted to try it out.

We had calamari fritti and octopus carpaccio for starters. Calamari was one of the toughest I've had. Octopus carpaccio had no flavour despite me trying desperately to get any flavour out of it. :D

The mains were better. Margherita pizza was nice, simple but tasty, with thin base. Seafood risotto had a big problem of tough seafood, not feeling fresh at all. Beef ragu pappardele was okay. Just expected deeper flavours with beef ragu cooked for 6 hours. Overall price and quality of food did not match.

Sitting space was very limited. We had a tiny table with barely enough space for 2 plates, cutlery, and glasses. In addition the table next to ours was very close. I was worried of smn sitting there since we would definitely have intervened in each other's spaces.

Service was good. However, I feel like the restaurant is trying to overcompensate poor food quality and high prices with overly attentive service."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Came to Faros in February. This is the best meal I‚Äôve ever had. Food was exceptional, and the staff were more than happy to give me as much basil as my heart desired (which is an absolutely obscene amount‚Äîmuch more basil was brought after this photo was taken). Service was incredible. Chef and his son are adorable. I wish I could eat at Faros every night. Every single course was a work of art. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Amazing restaurant. Super clean, food is fresh and delicious and our waitress Riya is just the sweetest person and offered excellent service. Definitely will be back."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"My wife and I celebrated our 51st anniversary at this wonderful restaurant,   the food variety and quality was outstanding.

We had a wonderful time in very elegant surroundings.
We highly recommend this restaurant, we will be back in the near future."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"It's so wise to choose this restaurant for your birthday this time! The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was immediately drawn in by its warm and elegant atmosphere. The soft lighting and soothing music blend perfectly, and every corner is filled with a sense of ceremony. The dishes are delicious. Waiter Mehmet provided meticulous and measured service throughout the meal, always paying attention to the needs without disturbing the dining rhythm. I had unforgettable birthday memories here. Both the food and the service were impeccable. Highly recommended!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,We were hosted by Ozzy and his service was amazing. He was friendly as well as very attentive. Food was lovely. Thank you for creating such a memorable experience for us!
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Exceptional experience, the food was excellent the fresh truffle pasta was delicious, as were the other dishes the other guest had, our glasses were never empty. The staff were kind and accommodating, special thanks to Mehmet, the atmosphere was light and the decor and music was timeless. Great for a lunch dressed casually or a dinner dressed up. They also surprised us with a birthday cake and song, would recommend."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had a great dinner at Faros! The Calamari Fritti was crispy and tender, and both the Risotto Mare and Linguine Allo Scoglio were rich and full of flavor ‚Äì we all loved it. Finished with a perfectly balanced Tiramisu, not too sweet.

Big thanks to Ozgur for the friendly and attentive service! Will come back againüíï"

Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"Very nice upscale restaurant in Oxford Circus. My family was seeking Italian food while on holiday in London and we found this place via Google reviews. We were not disappointed. The setting was great, the server was nice and patient and the food was amazing. The portion sizes are a little small considering the price. This was the only restaurant we visited that hit us with a VAT tax charge as well as a 12.5% service charge. The restaurant was packed and it was loud but we could still talk and enjoy our meals."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The most beautiful surprise, we had accidentally come to this restaurant and were not disappointed at all. No comments about the food, go taste it for yourself, it‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Also you will be lucky if Fozil is your waiter ( very kind guy ). Much recommended"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Wonderful Italian restaurant in SoHo. We showed up with a family of 5 without a reservation (not recommended!!). The staff was kind and accommodating. They turned the heaters on outside and even offered a lap blanket to my wife. Pasta was delicious and service was excellent. The vanilla ice cream was out of this world! We have spent the last week trying to find it for purchase. Pricey to feed a large family but worth every penny.
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Decided to go here on a whim and it was completely worth it. The restaurant was beautiful, the food was amazing (the best Italian food I‚Äôve ever had) and the staff was warm and welcoming. It was an overall exceptional dining experience. I absolutely recommend checking this place out if you are ever in the area."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had a fantastic experience at this Italian restaurant! Went with my husband and little one, super kid friendly.. The pasta was absolutely delicious ‚Äî perfectly cooked and full of flavor. We also tried the tiramisu, and it was one of the best I‚Äôve had; light, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness. The venue itself is beautiful, with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. A special shoutout to our waiter, Ozzy Ozzy, who was so attentive throughout the evening. He gave us great recommendations from the menu and made sure everything arrived promptly. Great service really made the night. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back!"
Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"Overall, amazing vibes and super attentive service but for what it cost, the food doesn‚Äôt quite live up to the hype. Starters like the calamari and burrata salad were fresh and tasted good but nothing to write home about. I had the pappardelle beef ragu - this was comforting and tasted good but compared to my other experiences with this dish, it was alright. The chocolate bomb for dessert was great - I do really recommend this! And the complimentary limoncello shot was a nice touch."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Arrived at 6:00 on a Friday and they were busy, but luckily the host was very helpful and they were able to provide a table for 5 with no wait.
Our server Ozgur was outstanding, very attentive, with good recommendations on meals, and care to ensure everything was to our liking.
Highly recommended, but next time I will get a reservation."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We had beef carpaccio and calamari for starters, both of them were wonderful. We also ordered carbonara and porcini risotto, the carbonara was delicious and the tiramisu was great too. The service from Fozil was amazing, he was so nice and gave recommendations to us. It was a fantastic experience."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Came for dinner and the place was buzzing with activity. Despite how busy it was, the staff were incredibly helpful and efficient. Every dish we tried was delicious, but I especially recommend the prawns with artichoke and asparagus, as well as the pappardelle with beef ragu, both were outstanding. Make sure to book your table in advance, as it gets quite busy!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The staff is polite and attentive, Ozzy and his colleagues did their utmost to provide us with a wonderful eating experience.
The food was absolutely delicious - every dish was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.

We‚Äôll definitely be coming back, and highly recommend Faros to anyone looking for great Italian food in central London."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Excellent! My Caprese was lovely but would have liked one more slice of tomato and basil rather than the leaves provided which were not as full of flavour. However the Fresh Pappardelle Beef Ragu was sensational! Not cheap but well worth it
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Just had lunch. Food was amazing. The service was even better.

Ruby our host was incredible, we were celebrating our friend‚Äôs birthday and she was fantastic."

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I had their sourdough bread, burrata tagliatelle and tiramisu for dessert. Sourdough bread was not the best but the tagliatelle and the tiramisu were on point. My friends on the table loved their al fungi pasta and pizza. Staff were friendly and accommodative of our requests!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Love the risotto. It tastes so delicious. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Italian cuisine
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had a wonderful dinner experience at Faros last week, that made us come back for  a second dinner three days later. The team at Farros were able to accomedate us and provide us with a table within five minutes of arrival without a prior booking. Even though the restaurant was relatively full. We were served by Ozzy who took very good care of us."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I've lost count of my visits, but every time feels like the first time I fell in love with this place. Personally, the star of their menu is undoubtedly the Calamari and the Truffle Pasta! Big thanks to our waiter Eggy, who was tremendously helpful and attentive."

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Last week, during our visit to London, we had the opportunity to experience this highly talked-about restaurant, which we had also come across on social media. As Manchester residents who frequently travel to London, discovering new culinary gems is always exciting for us.

I would particularly like to highlight the service‚Äî√ñzg√ºr looked after us exceptionally well, making our experience feel even more special. The presentation of the dishes was modern and creative, yet the authenticity of traditional flavours remained intact.

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"It's a good experience and the service is very good. Shrimp and squid rings are especially recommended for food, which are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Very authentic flavour and menu. Pleased to see affogato was on the menu and there were a variety of options for those who do not eat meat.

Will definitely be back next time we are in London"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We wanted to hate this place. The reviews can‚Äôt be true. Impossible for central London to be 4.9** but honestly.

Starter perfect, pesto great. Burrata fresh and not straight out the fridge.

Truffle pasta creamy and rich. Ragu plentiful and delicious. The desserts were also just lovely and light and the coffee was amazing.

Service also top notch and a song for my partners birthday was such a nice touch!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The food here is always amazing! I come here all the time and usually order the pasta and prawns. I‚Äôm quite picky with flavours, so it‚Äôs hard for me to find pasta and prawns that I really enjoy, but every time I get them here they‚Äôre made perfectly for me. Ozzy  is always very respectful and welcoming he makes my time here feel warm and enjoyable."

We were impressed by OZGUR professionalism and warm demeanor.
They truly enhanced our dining experience"
Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"Went on a Friday evening for an early dinner. We had a great time. The place itself has great decor, with open kitchen and bar. We shared all the dishes- Burrata salad, garlic bread, pizza and two pastas.

The menu offers great variety for vegetarians. There are plenty of dishes to choose from and could add extra ingredients to dishes if it was possible.

We were served by Ozgur. He was attentive and helpful."

Nice service too and highly recommend."

Highly recommend asking for him if you visit!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The food was simply delicious, each dish bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. Ozzy‚Äôs friendly and attentive service made the evening truly special ‚Äî he was quick to anticipate our needs and added a personal touch that made us feel at home. Highly recommended!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Faros, and I must say, it was an experience that truly stood out. From the moment I walked in, the classy yet homely atmosphere created an inviting and comfortable environment. The d√©cor strikes a perfect balance between elegance and warmth, making it ideal for both special occasions and a refined, casual meal.

To start, I ordered the minestrone soup, which was absolutely delicious. The broth was rich and well-seasoned, with a generous variety of fresh vegetables that gave it both texture and depth of flavor. The soup was served with bread, though I did find myself wishing for a bit of butter to accompany it ‚Äì a small touch that would have made the starter perfect.

For the main course, I opted for the fresh pappardelle beef ragu, and I can confidently say it was one of the best pasta dishes I‚Äôve ever had. The pappardelle itself was cooked to perfection ‚Äì tender with just the right amount of bite ‚Äì while the beef ragu was bursting with flavor. The sauce was rich, hearty, and clearly made with high-quality ingredients, creating a dish that was both comforting and indulgent.

Given the quality of the food and the overall high-end feel of the restaurant, the prices were on the higher side, but that‚Äôs to be expected for a place of this caliber. Honestly, considering the taste and presentation, I felt the meal was well worth the cost.

Service was another highlight of the evening. The staff were exceptionally friendly, attentive without being overbearing, and the food arrived impressively quickly. It‚Äôs clear that Faros prides itself not just on its menu but on delivering a complete dining experience.

Overall, my visit to Faros was outstanding. The combination of delicious food, quick and friendly service, and a classy yet cozy ambiance makes it a place I‚Äôd highly recommend. If you‚Äôre looking to treat yourself to an unforgettable meal, this is definitely the spot to visit."

We went on a Friday evening and booked a table on the same day, but considering it‚Äôs a busy place and all the tables were full, I would recommend booking at least few days in advance.

I would recommend, it is a very pretty place with a chill atmosphere."

Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Wonderful food, great selection of lunch/dinner options, drinks, and desserts - everything was fantastic and great value! The atmosphere was nice too, and it was no surprise that the queue was long (worth the wait) and tables all full. The staff were all so friendly and helpful too :)"
Govinda's Soho Street,3.0,"I tried the ¬£7.95 Veggie Thali at Govinda‚Äôs London, and overall it was a mixed experience. The food itself was quite average ‚Äî while the portion was fair, the flavors didn‚Äôt really stand out. The service also wasn‚Äôt the best. The server seemed impatient which affected the overall experience.That said, the place itself has a nice, homely vibe, and it feels welcoming if you‚Äôre looking for a simple vegetarian meal at a reasonable price."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I've visited Govinda's Restaurant two weeks ago, and I've enjoyed in great food and ambience, that not only filled my stomach, but also my soul. I was inspired with beautiful and peaceful energy! Service was also great and people were always full of laughter! I'm definetily looking forward to visit this place again someday! Greetings from Croatia! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"First time eating at Govinda and was definitely not disappointed. The food was fresh and tasty. Great selection. We got the large platter as we wanted to try a selection of the food on offer. The staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful.
Really relaxed atmosphere. I will return for sure!!!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"A Nourishing Experience at Govinda‚Äôs

Just shared a beautiful meal with an old friend at Govinda‚Äôs in London, and I‚Äôm still glowing from the experience. This vegetarian gem which caters for vegans with ease has such a warm, spiritual feel - it‚Äôs more than just food, it‚Äôs soul nourishment. The cuisine was absolutely fantastic: fresh, flavourful, and prepared with love. The staff were genuinely friendly and welcoming, adding to the sense of being cared for. A perfect blend of taste, atmosphere, and heart. Highly recommend for anyone craving more than just a meal."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"One of the last remaining gems of old soho! This place has soul and community, not just because of its spiritual roots, but because of its community engagement, accessible food prices and even free food! It‚Äôs so heart warming it‚Äôs survived so long and the people that work here are great!

Food is always delicious, hearty and filling, especially for the price! It can get very busy so during the week I recommend around 7pm to come and eat.

Thank you!"
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,"Food was fantastic and reasonably priced. Has a very Mom and Pop kinda feel to it. Not a ton of seating, but if you get lucky you can grab an outside table."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Delicious vegetarian food and lovely atmosphere! I returned several times during my recent stay in London and found the variety of options, portions and prices most agreeable. Highly recommend!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"All the food we ordered was delicious and really cheap, can‚Äôt recommend it enough! That being said keep in mind that this place is really popular and gets crowded so you will probably need to wait for some time to get food. Also it was really hot inside so we had to get everything as a takeaway."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,this was a super yummy thali!! very decently priced - i got the veggie & my friend got the deluxe which got good reviews. the berry lassi is amazing and also vegan so was very happy with this!! there is a big queue but people move fast and the staff were v friendly. would def return :))
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"The most delicious vegan and pure vegetarian food available here, mist visit if you want to enjoy such food and also the atmosphere is great. There are lots of other Indian snacks also available at a reasonable price. We also tried srikhand which is a dessert and it was delicious as well, I would have liked it more if the quantity was a bit more but overall it was a nice experience. Checkout the prices in the videos and the food as well. Hare Krishna üôèüèª"
Govinda's Soho Street,3.0,"Went to this place as read some good reviews and watched some videos on YouTube and must say was disappointed
The place was busy as we went for the lunch time so  expected it to be busy
The service was really bad and I was disappointed by this, I know it was busy the person on the till wanted me to make a donation and I was not too keen
I had the deluxe thali and the puri had all the oil from the fryer and when I asked can I have a different one she was not too keen
The veg samosa tasted nice
The curry with thali was a con, they were overloaded with veg and sag aloo had broccoli and cauliflower making it rubbish but it is also makes it look big
So very disappointing to experience and there is a lot of pressure to buy stuff or donate and I don‚Äôt like that
As a vegetarian the place did smell like I was in India but it didn‚Äôt taste as good
If you do go, go for the basic thali as that is worth the money if you go for anything then go for the first one of the thali which costs 7.99 and is most possibly the best option

So a no from me, like the temple and the ambience but the food is not just that good and the service can be better"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Excellent authentic food served by great people, Sujith, Krish and china aunty served best service. Must recommend to all devotees and great place for family. Hare Krishna"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Awesome food with best service in London. Got a really temple vibe. Very friendly and helpful staff too. Much recommended
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"We had a wonderful family lunch at Govinda‚Äôs in Soho, and it exceeded our expectations on every front. The food was wholesome, flavorful, and served with the kind of freshness that makes you want to come back often. The ambience strikes the perfect balance between warmth and simplicity, making it a welcoming space for both families and individuals.

What really stands out is the value for money,
considering its prime location in the heart of London, Govinda‚Äôs is refreshingly affordable without compromising on quality. The staff were courteous and attentive, which added to the overall experience.

A hidden gem in central London for anyone looking for delicious vegetarian fare in a relaxed and family-friendly setting. Highly recommended!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I‚Äôve been eating at Govindas for many years. The food is delicious wholesome and very well priced for central London. Despite being Hare Krishna infused, you find people from all walks of life eating there. It is a welcoming satvic environment üôÇ"
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,"nice lunch experience, full of straightforward well seasoned and heartwarming flavors:]    though the bread felt a bit stale and bland:[
there‚Äôs a lot of queue so come early!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Stylish, elegant and cozy art deco style restaurant with high quality and comfortably furnished seating, gourmet food and friendly service. It's recommended to book a table here in advance, as it's quite a popular place in a really active part of London. Especially recommend the tuna tartare, which is not only delicious, but also presented in an inventive way. Great experience and a pleasant time spent!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"Beautiful atmosphere with an elegant 1920s vibe‚Äîtruly stunning setting. The food was delicious, but unfortunately the service didn‚Äôt match the experience. We didn‚Äôt feel very welcomed, were rushed to order, and our server was quite inattentive. Every table around us received bread before their meals, but we didn‚Äôt. Our food took about 40 minutes to arrive, and basic condiments for the chips weren‚Äôt offered. Drink refills came after we had finished eating. With the right service, I‚Äôm sure our experience would‚Äôve been much better."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Original Ivy, West End is in a great location for theater goers!  Rather busy on a Monday night.  Service is fast.  I had the zucchini fries and the vegetable risotto which I loved.  For dessert, I had the truffles which were rich and decadent!  The bar menu is inventive and filled with many great cocktails.  Like most London restaurants, this one is small but feels much more cozy and comfortable than others."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"Wanted to visit the Ivy Original for a long time as we usually go to another one. From the outside it was little disappointing as the pavement and streets are little neglected and maybe would be nice to see some planters to brighten it up. However, on arrival the guy at the reception was very welcoming and the atmosphere and music really nice and sophisticated. The starters - watermelon  salad and gazpacho were delicious. Main course - shepherd's pie little disappointing, there was no garnish and found a couple of small pieces of bones. The dessert was disappointing too as the caramel sauce was not hot enough to melt our chocolate bombs. To be honest I am not surprised as the service was slow, the kitchen person would bring dishes into the trays and would not even call waiters to serve it. So effectively the dishes were sat there waiting to be served. Also a few discrepancies on the bill, some miscellaneous charges were added and the waiter could not explain what it was... Lovely venue but the service and food quality is not what it used to be and adding ¬£4 here and there  is not right. I guess most of people do not check but we had ¬£4 added and 2 charges of ¬£2 so ¬£8 in total - and they could not justify the charges"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Original Ivy in the West End was a treat.
Our Italian waiter was fantastic ‚Äì attentive and genuinely friendly, making the whole experience better.
The food was delicious. The Shepherd's Pie was rich and comforting with melt-in-your-mouth lamb and a perfect potato topping.
The fish and chips were spot on ‚Äì fresh, flaky haddock in crispy batter with great chips. Even the Ivy Burger was impressive, a juicy and flavorful classic.
The atmosphere is cozy and elegant, definitely a lovely spot for a special meal for decent prices.
Highly recommended."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"If you want to have a meal at an iconic restaurant then this is the place. You will experience the best service possible in the most delightful setting, ideal for the theatre or an unforgettable dining experience.
It's not cheap but That does not matter as what you get is what you pay for. Everything I had was perfect and the choices were enough for me to find choosing difficult.
Don't put off this experience. They really look after allergies with careful attention to gluten free choices."
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,The food presentation and cozy vintage ambiance were exceptional. Food was a bit pricey for the quality and quantity. I would return for the decadent Golden Hazlenut Bomb dessert - melting chocolate and vanilla dome with 24ct gold leaf and a hazelnut chocolate caramel sauce.  You watch as the waiter melts the chocolate dome containing ice cream with a warm caramel sauce.
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Absolutely phenomenal! The food was outstanding, the staff were so kind and incredible, and the environment was beautiful. Fantastic dinner before a show!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,The Ivy is a fantastic place that serves British food. I loved the atmosphere and there was live music during our visit. We tried the main 2 dishes: shepards pie and haddock & chips. Both were tasty and their portions are big.
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"Delicious food. Great service. Fab 1920s feel. Music a bit loud. Busy but not uncomfortable. Paid for water, unnecessary. I always think this is a trick to get more money. Overall lovley time."
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"Beautiful place, friendly staff. The food was delicious although some of it was a bit pricey, but everything we got, we liked! When we go back, I want to get the fish and chips this time, my husband got it and it was great!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"There is a reason that the IV in the west end is famous! Great food, and such a fun atmosphere. We were absolutely lucky to get reservations right at the bar just prior to our viewing of The Mousetrap, and it was the perfect combination for a wonderful evening."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"A first visit to this legendary establishment. Fantastic food, delicious cocktails, perfect ambiance and friendly staff.

Dorset crab, cheese souffl√©, crab linguine and The Ivy Shepherds pie ü•∞

We will be back"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"If you're heading to the West End for a show, and you appreciate good food, excellent service, quality cocktails in a historical and well appointed restaurant, a visit to The Original Ivy should be added to your itinerary.

Everything was perfect. I don't think they would accept anything less.

We had the Ivy Classic Crispy Duck Salad (‚Ç¨13.95) as an appetizer and the Shepherd's Pie with Mayfield Cheese (‚Ç¨21.95) and the Lamb Rendang Curry (‚Ç¨29.50) as entr√©es.

Thr duck salad was delightful with a variety of flavors that popped in your mouth.  Roasted cashew nuts provided some great texture, and the sesame and watermelon were still able tol shine through despite a light hoisin dressing.

As it was my first visit to London, I had to try some Shepherd's Pie.  Their version of the classic English dish was wonderful.  The gravy was excellent.  I elected to add the Mayfield Cheese, which was the right choice.  I saw at least six other patrons eating this dish, including the table next to us.  He was pleased with it, too.

We paired the meal with a few different wines, Ivy has an extensive list.  Do try their Honey Galzed Almonds (‚Ç¨4.50) with your opening cocktail.

We finished with the Selection of Cheeses (‚Ç¨13.95) and some Chocolate Truffles (‚Ç¨6.95).  There are five cheeses on the plate  along with an apple and apricot chutney.  A good blend of tastes from savory to sweet.  I did not enjoy the accompanying crackers. They tasted like cardboard.  Maybe ask for some bread instead.

The warm, inviting, and spot-on service starts when you walk in the door.  The meal was flawlessly executed. Great advice on wines and food choices, too.

Just a few blocks to the theater.  Thank you Ivy!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"We had a nice lunch with a group of 8 friends over the summer while staying at the nearby Ham Yard hotel.

We had appetizers, entrees and desserts for the table and everyone enjoyed the food, particularly the appetizers and desserts.  The cocktails were also well made.

Our server was pleasant and attentive, despite it being a crowded lunch service.  The restaurant is beautiful, but definitely hot inside.

I would recommend checking it out if in London."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Having arrived early we were sat at the bar and the bartender quickly took our order but our table became available fore he could deliver the drink. So they were forwarded to the table. Each of my drinks were a delight, having had the espresso martini and the berry rum bramble. My appetizer was the tuna tartare and the avocado was fresh giving a nice under lying flavor to the chilled raw tuna. Following that was the crab linguine special. The noodles were cooked to perfection and the crab was a delight. My dessert was the Ivy chocolate bombe. All I can say about this is AMAZING, save room for dessert. If you‚Äôre in the area for a show or need a dinner spot. This has to be a top selection."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"I‚Äôve visited the Ivy over the years and I was a little disappointed tonight. The atmosphere is great and service great. They used to make a killer hamburger, not sure why a tough overcooked one is in the menu. Rib eye steak was okay, red wine sauce was tasty. Mashed potatoes were bland. I like to leave positive reviews but I have to be honest too / I wish ‚Äòbubbles and squeak‚Äô was still on the menu. I had a Canadian WWII friend who told me in the 1990s that the cooks would feed him and other soldiers during the war - pretty great! I think of the Ivy as an English institution. There were several dishes missing from the menu sadly. The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was the best part of the meal. Definitely recommend! Great place for a quick bite before catching a show in the area."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,Took my husband here before our Theatre Show as a treat.  Wow it was fantastic.  The food was gorgeous and all the staff were a credit to the Ivy.  Thank you all for a lovely and special evening.  (Just wish I had seen Cliff Richardü§£ xx
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,I took my Korean friend to have a good experience of British dinner. We had a two course meal with complimentary bread. We had a wonderful time catching up on our lives and a good1 meal.
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"A staple for locals and a few tourists.  Fish pie is wonderful, creamy with lobster shrimp salmon.  10 quid martinis special.  And by all means save room for sticky toffee pudding, and a chocolate bomb too!  Under 150 quid for 2: 4 drinks, app, 2 mains, dessert!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The wonderful original Ivy restaurant in West Street London and still the best of the Ivy Collection. On a very busy Saturday evening in the West End (24/08/2024) it was an oasis of calm. Of course, it isn't as it was years ago when staff had individual roles, eg, a cocktail waiter, a sommelier etc., but our server was excellent as was the food and drinks. An evening at the Ivy doesn't come cheap but who would want it any other way. A place to go for a special occasion. Extras include service @ 13.5% + a ¬£2 cover charge per person.

Update 11/03/2025:- Came again for a celebratory evening and enjoyed another superb meal. Don't get me wrong our server was lovely but maybe not ""quite"" as professional as the one we had last year ü§î It's a tiny criticism. We only had a cocktail each and no wine which brought the bill down considerably. Footnote of possible interest: my father, a young Frenchman living in London, was a cocktail waiter at the Ivy in the 1930s so it has a very special place in my family's heart ‚ù§Ô∏è More photos added."
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"The food and atmosphere were great, but the service was disappointing. It was my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday on the day we visited, so I requested a birthday plate in advance. Even though I double-checked both by phone and online, they completely forgot. On top of that, they also forgot our order, which caused a delay and made us late for our musical. Honestly, the service wasn‚Äôt worth the service charge."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Their pre-theatre menu is amazing! Two courses for ¬£29.99, we opted for mains and dessert.
Everything was full of flavour. The portions are on a smaller side but that‚Äôs expected. You‚Äôd need an extra side dish also."
"The Original Ivy, West End",1.0,"We dined at The Ivy West End before a show and unfortunately, it was a letdown. Service was incredibly slow‚Äîwe were nearly late for the performance despite ordering from the theatre menu. Staff seemed distracted and inattentive throughout or just very poorly organized. The food didn‚Äôt redeem the experience: the lamb was served raw, portions were disappointingly small, and overall quality was poor. The only saving grace was the chocolate bomb dessert, which was genuinely delightful. However, given the high prices and underwhelming service, it‚Äôs not worth it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to others."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I am giving this restaurant an all FIVE STARS. Location is excellent and easy to access. The food is super delicious.
The best of it all is the service. The staff are so friendly, welcoming and caring.
The atmosphere is warm and friendly with lots of beautiful vibes. It's a place to visit and I will go there again and again. I will recommend Original Ivy to everyone.
Thanks to a wonderful staff team."
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"We had booked this lunch meal as a treat for me and my wife., looking forward to the experience. The Original Ivy has had a great reputation for years. Unfortunately it fell short of expectations and I will never be returning .

Despite having a reservation, we were made to queue for 15 minutes before being seated. Once inside, the service was inconsistent: we had to repeatedly ask for water, and waited between 45 to 60 minutes for our main course, while other tables were served far more promptly. The cheese souffl√© arrived cold, and the fish in the fish and chips was dry, with chips that were warm but not hot. We were also charged a cover fee despite no bread being presented.

While we appreciated the gesture of a discount at the time, it didn‚Äôt make up for the overall experience, which felt far below the standard we had anticipated. The only highlight was the martini, which was excellent!

Unfortunately this was the second bad ‚Äú Ivy‚Äù experience I‚Äôve had recently, the last being at Richmond.

My sense is that maybe new ownership is milking a hard earned reputation and letting standards drop in the name of profit- I could be wrong, hope I am.

Good luck guys."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"We went there for fish and chips. We had to make a reservation. They take your coat to the front desk and give you a number to return it. The food was the best fish and chips that we tried in London.
The atmosphere is cozy and calm, considering we are in Europe, and everything is smaller and tighter than in the US."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Went with kids, pleased they had a kids menu. Food in general was very good, cocktails and desert even better. service was stellar."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I had the pleasure of dining at The Ivy recently, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The food was absolutely delicious. it's clear that the chefs take great pride in their craft.

What truly stood out, however, was the service. From the moment we arrived, the hostess Ms. Binta, made us feel right at home. She greeted us with a warm smile, was attentive without being overbearing, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the evening. Her friendly demeanor and professionalism added a personal touch that really made the experience special."
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"Went to The Ivy thinking it was going to be something special, however, the tables are placed so close to each other I could hear the conversation from the tables either side of us - it just felt so clostrophobic. I'm guessing the tables are so close so they can get as many covers in as possible but this ruins the atmosphere. You just cannot talk in a normal voice, you have to whisper unless you want the tables either side of you knowing what you're talking about. Shame really.
The food wasn't that special either.
Been there, done that. Tick in the box but will not be going there again. There are far better places in London and cheaper than The Ivy to eat."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"As always, our visit to the Ivy was brilliant. Super set menu, lovely atmosphere and perfect for a pre show meal!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Had a fantastic meal here, the food was amazing and certainly worth the money, try the Shepherds pie which is to die for.

The staff were efficient and did all they could to speed our meal up before the concert.

A truly perfect meal, Thanks to the manager Karim."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Loved it so much. Great service amazing vibes in a beautiful, characterful and vintage interior. Liked that it is fairly relaxed while feeling sophisticated and food prices and very reasonable. Food was fantastic too. Great shepherds pie and steak tartare!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I recently had lunch at The Ivy in London with my girlfriend, and it was a fantastic experience. I opted for the Malaysian Curry, which was really flavourful and perfectly spiced, while my girlfriend enjoyed the Tuna Steak, which was cooked to her perfection. Both meals were delicious felt of high quality. The  atmosphere was pleasant, with a traditional & stylish setting that made our lunch feel special. Overall, it was a delightful dining experience, and we can‚Äôt wait to return!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"I‚Äôve always liked the Original because of the decadent design. Food is always on par but I do feel it‚Äôs over all too quickly. Starters appear with minutes of ordering followed immediately by dinner and dessert. I think the whole visit was just over an hour. I assume they like a quick turnover?
Staff are a little tense but overall it‚Äôs a nice experience"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"From the moment you step inside The Ivy, you are greeted with an atmosphere of classic elegance and charm. The restaurant‚Äôs sophisticated interior, paired with impeccable service, makes for an unforgettable dining experience.

The Culinary Highlights

Starter: The smoked salmon was a delight‚Äîfresh, buttery slices adorned with cucumber, microgreens, and cr√®me fra√Æche, complemented by dark rye bread. A light yet flavorful beginning.

Main Course: A beautifully cooked steak, topped with a rich b√©arnaise sauce, served alongside crispy golden fries. A perfect balance of indulgence and refinement.

Dessert: The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was a masterpiece‚Äîsilky smooth custard beneath a perfectly caramelized, crisp sugar crust. A divine way to end the meal.

With an atmosphere that blends history, sophistication, and culinary excellence, The Ivy truly lives up to its reputation. Every bite was a testament to the restaurant‚Äôs commitment to quality, making this visit an absolute delight.

Would I return? Absolutely!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"It‚Äôs been over a month since our visit to Ivy, yet we‚Äôre still reminiscing with gratitude about the exceptional hospitality of the charming hostess, Ksenia. She truly saved our Saturday evening by accommodating our spontaneous request to extend our reservation. Her attentiveness, kindness, and understanding were beyond impressive.

The food was delicious, the service impeccable, and the ambiance simply delightful. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience.

Thank you, Ksenia, for making our visit so memorable. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The food is fantastic, albeit overpriced for some things, IMHO. The service was impeccable and it seemed all we had to do was think about getting the server‚Äôs attention and someone would show up asking if we needed anything.
The interior is a bit dated and looks like it doesn‚Äôt know what kind of restaurant it wants to be.  This is a chain, with many locations. I‚Äôve been to a few and they are fairly consistent with this review."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Amazing food! Arancini was to die for, absolutely delectable. Highly enjoyed every course, absolutely worth the money"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The food and vibe are fantastic, but know that service can be a bit slow. That being said for a night out on Soho it's the perfect place to start."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Ivy offers an exceptional dining experience with incredibly delicious food. The menu features a selection of classic English dishes alongside numerous vegetarian options, which are available on a separate menu.

The staff are incredibly attentive, ensuring a pleasant dining experience.

The interior is very traditional and beautifully decorated, adding to the overall charm of the restaurant.

The food is truly delectable. It is advisable to reserve a table a few days in advance to ensure availability."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Ivy original hits differently than the other ones anywhere in London.
The place is rather small so I recommend booking in advance.
Food was brilliant.
The ivy has high standards and it rarely disappoints!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"I love the Ivy and have been to many of them across the country, I was disappointed with our meal at London City Garden though.
We were offered water, which we expected to be a fair cost, but ¬£11 for 2 glasses, felt totally unnecessary. Especially as the water retails at ¬£1.50 a bottle.
My starter and main meal (chicken Milanese)  was very bland - I gave up half way through. My husband ordered a steak and a side of creamed greens which tasted off and he left them.
The service was lovely, as was atmosphere. They were also good at receiving feedback and offered a refund on the items we didn‚Äôt like;  but I have to say I won‚Äôt return in a while as the water price just felt like needless profiteering."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"Great food, friendly service. Perfectly cooked beef wellington. They decided to seat another couple extremely close to us even though the restaurant was empty at the time. We had a hard time holding a conversation without it seemingly spread to next table. At least we influenced their meal since it was so close it was basically a display for them."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Original Ivy is one of those places I keep coming back to every time I‚Äôm in London, it‚Äôs right in the heart of the West End and perfect before or after the theatre, the Shepherd‚Äôs Pie is still the best I‚Äôve ever had and the tuna tartare and sea bass are always flawless, I ended the meal with the apple tarte tatin and ice cream which was warm, and just the right amount of sweet, the service is quick even when it‚Äôs packed like it was on a Wednesday night and everyone is so professional but friendly, the bar menu is creative with cocktails that actually surprise you, the space feels intimate and stylish without being pretentious, yes it‚Äôs pricey but totally worth it because the food and experience are just on another level, honestly it‚Äôs one of those meals you think about long after and always look forward to doing again."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I had an absolutely delightful experience at The Ivy West End. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was warm, elegant, and inviting, a perfect blend of classic charm and modern sophistication. The interior decor is beautifully done, with soft lighting, lush greenery, and a buzzing yet relaxed vibe that makes it feel both upscale and comfortable.
The service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed to care about the guest experience. My waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations without being pushy. I started thinking could this be my lucky day.
As for the food, it was outstanding. I ordered the crispy duck salad as a starter and the blackened cod for the main. Both were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavour. The dessert (a melting chocolate bombe) was pure indulgence and a fantastic end to the meal.
What really stood out for me was the attention to detail. From the beautifully presented dishes to the seamless service and ambience that complemented the dining experience without overpowering it.
Whether you‚Äôre celebrating something special or just want a memorable dining experience in the heart of London, The Ivy West End is well worth it. I'll definitely be back."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Had a fantastic dinner at The Original Ivy in the West End. The atmosphere is classy without feeling stuffy, and the staff were super friendly.

Would definitely go back!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"We dined at The Ivy West Street on the evening of 22nd May to celebrate a birthday. While we had high expectations for the experience, we unfortunately encountered extremely unprofessional service that deeply disappointed us.

After our mains, my friend kindly asked the waiter for dessert recommendations for a birthday celebration. His reply was simply, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù Later, when we politely asked to check the bill, he responded twice with ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚Äî leaving us confused, uncomfortable, and frankly, disrespected.

We were unsure whether the tone was meant to be humorous, but it felt inappropriate, especially in such a premium establishment. This was not what we expected from a restaurant of this reputation and price point.

We also reached out via email and the official contact form on their website shortly after our visit, but received no reply.

Attaching the bill here for reference ‚Äî we were Table #10, served by a staff member named Erdal. Hopefully this feedback will be taken seriously to prevent other guests from having a similar experience.

Highly disappointed, and sadly, this tainted what should have been a joyful birthday dinner."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"What a fabulous restaurant to dine. Attentive service, beautiful Art Deco decor and delicious meals were had by all of our party of 5.

"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I hadn‚Äôt been to a restaurant in The Ivy chain before so didn‚Äôt know what to expect. It was great, the decor is stylish, the staff friendly & helpful & the food was delicious. I found the food reasonably priced for London. Will be back to visit another soon."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"You can't beat the location and the food is reasonable. However, the service is poor.  Front-of-house and waiters were unfriendly and unwelcoming, we had to ask four times for the cocktails that we ordered before they were brought to our table, by which time  we had already had our starters delivered. There are other restaurants in central London that charge similar prices and have more charm."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Son took me for my birthday ,waitress was excellent.  Food was top quality üëå"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Reservations suggested! We did not have a reservation, and offered to sit at the bar, but were grateful to the hostesses that made accommodations to have a seated at a table. It did seem like we were inconveniencing them even though the restaurant was half empty (6:30 on a Monday) as they did allude to the fact that they were about to be very busy with tables coming in before nearby shows.

White tablecloth dining experience. Food was incredible and came out very fast! Honestly, my favorite thing I ate in all of London! They take English classics to the highest level of execution!

We didn‚Äôt get our cocktails until halfway through our meal that we ordered upon arrival - only reason for 4 stars on service. Our server was attentive (again - seemed like we were kind of an inconvenience) but regardless, we were checked in with and given speedy service. Gratuity fee 12.5% was already added to the bill.

Although the restaurant was a little warm for us, they did have silent fans dispersed throughout which helped. Aside from the warmth, the atmosphere was upbeat and lively, lots of well-dressed guests and families, enjoying this beautiful, eclectic and colorful restaurant!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"There was a live singer and she made the whole time there worth every minute. They food tasted better because of her! Fantastic! Great food, good portions. Kids did say their food wasn't that great but our adult food was super."
"The Original Ivy, West End",1.0,I would avoid this place. Rib eye had zero seasoning and was bland.  Mashed potatoes same.  Just a starchy taste.  Service was non existent. Fish was pretty good but missing sides I ordered.  Had to ask bartender for salt and pepper and I was sitting at a table. Not the bar.  Waiter disappeared and had to chase staff around for check. Never again.
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,Had s lovely meal the wife's beef Wellington was under cooked but they quickly replaced it and didn't charge us for it . Would definitely go back lovely atmosphere and friendly staff.
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"An upscale, art deco restaurant and bar in the heart of London. Staff engaging and professional. Delicious food and wine. Wonderful vegetarian menu; literally a separate menu so you don't have to sort it out on your own. Fresh and flavorful. I had the truffle ravioli. Wonderful with Sancerre!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,Yet another great meal at an Ivy restaurant.  Excellent food and service on the pre theatre menu. Well worth a visit. The onion soup was lovely as was the Sea Bream.
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"I visited The Ivy on West Street over the bank holiday weekend to celebrate my mum‚Äôs birthday. The food ‚Äî both the starters and mains ‚Äî was pretty good, but the desserts were truly outstanding, especially the chocolate bomb! I highly recommend it.

Though the seating was quite tight, the atmosphere was lovely, and what made the experience even better was the exceptional service.
We were served by Francesco, who was absolutely fabulous!!! He was very attentive, friendly, and upbeat. He really elevated the whole experience, making it a definite 10/10!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"What an amazing experience it is dining at this restaurant!
It was my first time at a fine dining restaurant and I absolutely loved it, everything is done so right that you feel like you want to back again and again.
We started with some delicious cocktails at the bar while waiting to be seated at our table, when it became available we could enjoy our food.
We had delicious bread and butter to start, some cheese sufl√™ and some tempura prawns as starters, cottage pie and the breast chicken with a truffle filling for mains, and as desserts we had the valentines raspberry choux and the coconut sorbet, everything cooked to perfection.
The flavours are so well combined, completely different than anything I‚Äôve tried before.
The service is 5 stars, didn‚Äôt wait too long to get served, all the foods arrived with no time.
Our glasses never get empty as someone will refill it while we enjoy the amazing food.
There was someone playing a violin so beautifully, what a beautiful way of celebrating the Valentine‚Äôs Day!
I‚Äôll certainly be back!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",2.0,"We ordered from here, Fish & Chips. No chips, no lemon but two slices of stale toast. The fish pieces were like 3.5‚Äù at best. One bite and gone and not even a good bite. $17 for what? Never again. Misrepresentation and no money back from Uber Eats."
"The Original Ivy, West End",1.0,"We booked our reservation months in advance for 6 PM‚Äîour first night back in London for our honeymoon. I studied at Oxford, so returning to the UK for this trip was incredibly meaningful to us. We were especially excited for a special evening at The Ivy, followed by a showing of The Mousetrap at St. Martin‚Äôs Theatre.

Unfortunately, the experience didn‚Äôt live up to the occasion. We were seated at a strange, awkwardly angled table where I couldn‚Äôt even face my wife‚Äîinstead, I was positioned directly across from another couple, who also seemed uncomfortable with the setup.

It took 25 minutes just to order a drink. We had to order our starters and mains all at once to make it to our play on time. Oddly, the mains arrived first, with the starter following a few minutes later. The food was underwhelming‚Äînothing bad, but certainly not what we expected from such a highly regarded restaurant. Comparable to decent street food at best.

Our server‚Äîwho had bandages on his face‚Äîseemed rushed and disengaged. Overall, it felt like the staff were just going through the motions, not delivering the warm, polished service we‚Äôd hoped for on such a special night.

We expected more from an establishment with The Ivy‚Äôs reputation. BE BETTER‚Äîfor the sake of your future guests, and for the experiences that should feel truly special.

Won‚Äôt be back and will tell friends to avoid."
"The Original Ivy, West End",4.0,"Well it is The Ivy! Nice old decor and amazing ladies bathroom! Went for lunch and they have a great lunch menu for 2 courses for ¬£19 and add ¬£5 if you still have room for dessert.  Great choices for the lunch menu. We had the squid and bang bang chicken salad starters which were all very good. For main we all had the shepherds pie which was delicious! Served with gravy. Ordered a couple of sides, creamed spinach and green beans with almonds.
Dessert was frozen berries with sorbet and creme brulee which was delicious!!

Lovely ambiance and good service. Highly recommend it for lunch! Be sure to make a reservation though."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The most loveliest place I've been to. We booked on the day for a table and was greeted and taken to our seats. We had an amazing server who came and chatted. She was the highlight of the day! If you ever go to The Ivy just talk to the servers and chat to them. The downside was I went to the men's toilets and as I cupped my hands for the soap dispenser, it squirted up and onto my glasses and hair. White soap doesn't look good smeared on glasses after coming out of a bathroom. Although you may feel the prices are steep because of the location it isn't. I'd say it's on par with usual London prices. The service was amazing and the food was quick. Sheppard's Pie was delicious and although you have to wait 14 mins (a joke we had with our server), it's worth it for the experience. Really can't wait to go back. Really lovely."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"My husband arranged my birthday lunch at The Ivy. It was a few years since we have visited so it was great to return.

We received excellent, friendly and accommodating service and enjoyed the meal. The restaurant provided a delicious birthday cake, that my husband had arranged in advance.

It was a very special lunch and we were very well looked after.

Many thanks to the manager and staff."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Still my favourite restaurant of all The Ivy  Collections. Dined with my father and we were greeted by the wonderful Carolina and looked after by Karim the restaurant manager. Service and food were faultless.

The restaurant just oozes class and sophistication. Something very special."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"The Best Brasserie, restaurant all over London. Some can be pricy, but it's worth it. Everything is absolutely amazing, food, service, atmosphere. Each have their inside decor depending where The Ivy is located. Sublime"
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Wonderful place to visit on a day out in London, made the whole experience feel very luxurious. Service was generally attentive but it was quite busy so difficult to pay attention to everyone at once. I myself had the scallops and the ravioli which was delicious with the shaved truffles on top, and the scallops were delicious with excellent presentation. They made my mum feel very special on her 60th birthday with a plate of chocolate truffles on the house, and for fairly fine dining, the price was not too exorbitant between 5 people."
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"Lovely food, but the service really let the place down. It took more than 35 minutes for someone to come to take our order (after I had to ask someone for help) despite the restaurant being half full, and during the first course they came to take our plates before we were finished.

All in all, while I can not fault the food (the prawns are amazing), it isn't a place that I will rush back too."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"We went for Monday lunch and it was great. Place wasn‚Äôt busy, food was delicious and service was great. ¬£86 for 2 people including a beer each (1/2 pint). It would have been around ¬£70 without the beer. In summary, expensive but worth it and I‚Äôd definitely go back."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Decided to top our day off at one of London's iconic eateries - the Original Ivy, West End.  Reservations a must here, unless you want to take your chances finding a seat at the bar, which looked pretty full all night.  Since we got there a bit early, we started at the bar and enjoyed a great cocktail menu (they are not fooling around with their drinks - expensive, but very high quality).

We were seated in a comfy booth, and given a nice overview of the menu and specials.  We opted for a Spanish red wine that was delicious (their 15-page wine list is full of great options).  The food was all solid, no complaints at all, but for the price, nothing was truly exceptional ... not to say I wouldn't go back to explore more and different items.

The real fun started when our new-ish waiter attempted a table-side production for the Baked Alaska we ordered.  At one point I figure it was 50/50 odds that something not meant to be on fire was going to be on fire and our dessert ended up slightly over""baked"".  The real problem was the senior waiter that openly chastised the lad in front of several patrons, including some sneering and sideways glances of contempt for his younger colleague ... nobody spending 00+ a person wants to witness that kind of nonsense - take it to the back room next time.

Glad we went and experienced this place."
"The Original Ivy, West End",5.0,"Lovely!
We visited in for my husbands birthday.
The service was outstanding.
All staff were lovely.
(I was slightly put off by a male member of staff that seemed to be a bit grumpy with some of the very hard working ladies there. I have no idea what he could be grumping about - as we found them all delightful)
Food was delicious - main and dessert.
Everything arrived quickly.
Cocktails were top notch.
The 'Happy Birthday' truffles for my husband were a very nice touch- we were not expecting it at all - which made it even nicer!"
"The Original Ivy, West End",3.0,"While visiting London last during an extended layover, we decided to spend an evening enjoying dinner and a show. Looking to experience a classic yet unique British/ French dinning experience is what lead us to select The Ivy, on West St.

We were very impressed with the atmosphere and upscale experience provided by the staff. Unfortunately the food was not as elevated as the rest of our experience here. While atmosphere is important, we really try to make an extra effort to visit restaurants with quality foods to enjoy while exploring a new city.

I won‚Äôt go into detail about what we ordered as the menu has changed.

To keep this even shorter, superb vibes, clean restaurant, and excellent staff. However I would not return due to the lack lustre quality of the food that was served."
Dunkin',1.0,They have seats but get mad at you for using them‚Ä¶ I got yelled at for sitting while waiting for my mobile order very odd. Should‚Äôve asked if I was waiting for mobile first.
Dunkin',5.0,The Dunkin Donuts in Huguenot Town looks great! Very comfortable and clean.  It‚Äôs a very busy location especially with the high school kids but all of the staff is great and very friendly and welcoming!

Dunkin',2.0,"The blonde old lady is horrible at making drinks. My coffee tasted like straight milk, even though I added blueberry flavoring (which I tasted NONE of), and it was almost completely white. Not an ounce of sugar, flavoring, or COFFEE. JUST MILK.
And not even good milk, it was somehow extremely bitter? How is it bitter without the taste of coffee? The other workers make it perfectly though."

Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,"Management needs to do a better job here, feels like a hangout for teenagers instead of them working.  I went in when they just opened up and got leftover food, Horrible. Had no chips because the kid that makes the chips quit."

Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,"Workers were absolutely zooted , including the speaker and near the windows. It was ringing in my ear, making me almost throw up and then I wanted to get some cold water to cool down my headache, and it turned out to be warm. I tried to get ice, but there wasn‚Äôt so what the hellY If I could put -8, I would"
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2.0,Really happy to a new see Chipotle near me.  Love the brand but the new store that just opened is a mess. Tremendous trash over flowing in the trash bins and the tables are disgustingly dirty.  Please do something quickly. This is not good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,Very disorganized order. Got a burrito bowl with sour cream EVERYWHERE. Where are my vegetables? Rice sour cream and beans with little bits of chicken..
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,"I love chipotle but I am really not impressed with the new location that opened near me here in tottenville. Every time I walk in no one greets you and everyone has a long face on. If you ask a question, it‚Äôs answered under their breath making no eye contact. I went in with my son who is 2 who said hi to one of the cashiers and no one even acknowledged him. The other day we just decided to go to the location in Woodbridge and were greeted with smiles and a warm welcome. Not saying they need to be over the top but some eye contact and maybe a welcome to chipotle wouldn‚Äôt hurt. Just sad to see this location just opened and a place that I love to eat has such miserable workers."
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,Order twice both times got there and my order was already marked as picked up. Both times I waited at least 25 mins past pick up time. The staff is not one bit friendly and the lady making the take out ordered is clearly overwhelmed and apologizes 100 times. I watched a male staff member blatantly ignore someone while they were asking a question and walked away. It was abnormal.. they do not want to work..
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5.0,"Really Nice Service, special mention to Jar"
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5.0,Best food with friendly service
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,Employees were clueless / food sucked
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5.0,"We all have different experiences, my experience in this location is amazing üòª. My order was made on time, the restaurant is super clean, the team are very friendly, only thing I would said is work with sense of urgency but all then that I love this location definitely will go back. ü´∂üôÇüòå"
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,"Please do not eat here, i got a Honey Chipotle chicken burrito and now i am stuck at home with food poisoning, the stomach pain is unimaginable. The kitchen is unsanitary and the food is not fresh. This location should be shut down by the health department as other people also went through the same thing i am. Do yourself and your body a favor and stay far far away from here."
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,"This is the worst chipotle I‚Äôve ever been to. Food is still solid but whoever manages this place has no idea what they are doing. If u order food for pick up expect to wait for 20 minutes or if in person, you‚Äôre waiting for chicken. They need more employees!"
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5.0,"This is one of the best locations that I‚Äôve seen of Chipotle, good food, good people.  Definitely üíØ my best experience in chipotle. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5.0,love the food . very nice manager . She made sure our experience was amazing .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5.0,"OMG must i say this is by far the best chipotle on the island im not going to lie. The employees are still learning but they are trying to, i can see their effort. the service was good , the food was amazing , and the dining room was real nice and clean . Rate this experience a 10/10 . Thank you"
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,Been waiting over 40 mins for my mobile order and order hasn‚Äôt even been started yet. Giant crowd of people standing around the pickup area.. Garbage is overflowing. Where is the management?
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,Place is messy and unsanitary. Waiting almost an hour for a pick up order. Go to any of the locations and save yourself the trouble
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5.0,The food was very amazing and the staff were really nice
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,"Empty with being the 4th person on line and having waited 15 mins just to order. Need to hire more employees or train the employees to support one another for efficiency. Only employee who is on point 6/18/25 6pm is the order to go worker. Cashier just stands at cash register instead of usual condiment finishing as at others. Cook, on point on refilling the empty line items."
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5.0,"Finally Tottenville has its very own Chipotle,no more trips to the mall,Tried it for the first time 6/18,the food was exceptionally fresh and the portions were very generous,will be back for sure!!"
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,"Food is cold, terrible customer service, no respect to customers. Very disappointed, wouldn‚Äôt recommend ."
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,Food got me sick! I‚Äôve never had a problem with chipotle before but this location sucks. The beans were mushy and bowl was half empty. You‚Äôd expect the food to be good as they just had their grand opening.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,<NA>
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,"Been waiting 2 hours for a pick up, no way to cancel it. I spent nearly $50, am 7 months pregnant and there‚Äôs no way to cancel your order and get a refund. I get being short staffed, the staff was working hard and were nice and I was not rude while inquiring about my order, but this is crazy. If you‚Äôre short staffed, turn off your online orders. There‚Äôs one poor girl doing all the online orders. The manager should be looking out for his staff better. Was excited to have this in the neighborhood, especially as an option while running errands to pick something up quickly on the way home, but never again. We have better local options to patronize here.

Edited to add: got my order at 10 pm, completely wrong. Multiple missing items and check out the ‚Äúquesadilla‚Äù. They ran out of cheese hours ago supposedly.  Soda is also flat and look at the mess."
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,The employees at this location are nasty they really are specialy the so called manager i assume that's what he was cutting the chicken up and just throwing it into the bins the kitchen area is gross honestly last time I'd order from here
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,We ordered bowls and a burrito. The bowls were half full with very little meat  and the burrito was more rice than anything.  I‚Äôve been to other locations and they did the right thing. I will never go to this location again.  For over $15 for a bowl there should be more than rice and a few chunks of meat in it. Total ripoff in my eyes.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3.0,Love chipotle but they barely filled up my bowl and I had to ask them for more. Chips were stale. Chipotle by the mall is better
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2.0,"I ordered in person and the employees were delightful. All were kind and were willing to help me. Unfortunately, the food was not as pleasant. The tortilla chips were stale, the pico de gallo was grainy, and the chicken was rubbery. Just overall not great quality and not fresh."
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4.0,Fast service
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1.0,"The bowl was more than half empty, couldn‚Äôt get chips online, refused to take my code for free chips, said i need to buy something else after spending 20$ on food"

Wendy's,1.0,"I was absolutely disgusted to find that the chicken sandwich and chicken wrap I ordered were MOLDED. In all my life I've never had such an alarming fast food experience.

It made me seriously question the food safety, quality control, and overall care taken behind the scenes by everyone who works here. Serving molded food is a major health hazard - plain and simple. I know I‚Äôll never be ordering from this location again."
Wendy's,5.0,Ordered through the drive through. Got chilling with onions and cheese. I went home and put the chilli in tacos along with some shredded lettuce and tomatoes with sour cream and I had a delicious meal for just 4$
Wendy's,1.0,Customer service was horrible I didn‚Äôt even get to say my entire order and the lady on the phone said stop calling me when I just wanted to order me and my daughter food
Wendy's,1.0,"Today i ordered 2 jr. Hamburgers and a small fry. When i got home i noticed 3 charges on my credit card, two for $8.70 and one fir $6.50. i called store about 30 minutes later to hear that no manager was in site. The person i spoke to told me they couldn't locate any such order and gave me a manager's number to call. I tried calling and leaving a detailed message but so far no return call. I guess at this point i can try and dispute the charges through the bank credit card company."
Wendy's,1.0,"Went in to grab a drink and order food for my husband today. Was standing at the counter where a Manager was at the register printing out a bunch of different receipts. She didn‚Äôt acknowledge me standing there just continued and I wasn‚Äôt worried because she was doing her job. We made eye contact twice as she‚Äôs doing this then she lays the recipes down and balls some up and walks away. Now I‚Äôm trying to see who will be coming to take me order. I notice a female (picture below) began making chicken nuggets while eating a mouthful of fries (NO GLOVES OR HAIRNET WITH VERY LONG HAIR) as well and I was shocked and making a face and another employee (she is pictured as well no hairnet HAIR PULLED TO FRONT handling food) saw me and saw her eating and was looking just as shocked as me. There was a young man making a guy a soda and once he finished he stopped he looked at us and begin looking into the lobby. We were there about 10 minutes and now a line started forming behind us. We then said we would just go to the one by our house when we noticed all the orders backed up on the screen near the front counter. We proceeded to leave and SOON as we stepped out, the young man is finish daydreaming all of a sudden and can take their order immediately! We came BACK inside and asked why were we waiting so long and soon as the next people step forward they are attended to by two different staff members! Mind you, we were the ONLY black patrons in the establishment at the time so to be not seen and then NOT HEARD is sad and very disappointing. More disgusting is that people are still openly discriminating on people because of their race in 2025 and at a WENDYS no less! I will make sure this gets to the proper channels so no one else will feel so small in an ordinary fast food restaurant like Wendy‚Äôs again."

Wendy's,1.0,"I went into the drive thru and ordered 2 of there new fuego fries what I got back was horrifying. It looked like a chicken nugget of takis powder . When I even broke it up and shook the bag for a while nothing changed it regular fries with a little bit of the spicy. If you are looking for Wendy‚Äôs please do not go here pick another one. This isn‚Äôt even the first time, the quality of food here is terrible and the manager should really keep a look at the food there serving."
Wendy's,1.0,"The staff is terrible. Went to pickup my order, had multiple items missing. Tried to wait to correct the order , was ignored by every worker for over 10 mins as I waited.

The food is fine, it‚Äôs Wendy‚Äôs. But the staff, I‚Äôll go out of my way to go somewhere else. Rude and unfriendly."
Wendy's,1.0,I live near this wendys and have been going periodically for years. They consistently get my order wrong and charge me incorrectly. I will not be going here anymore.
Wendy's,3.0,"Usually slow service

Ciro Pizza Cafe,5.0,I met some friends from high school. I live in New Jersey and haven't been back to Staten Island for a while and I couldn't believe the quality of the pizza. It was delicious!
Ciro Pizza Cafe,1.0,"This was hands-down the worst dining experience I‚Äôve ever had. My boyfriend and I came in for a meal and received unbelievably poor service from our waitress. She repeatedly placed our food and drinks on empty seats across from us‚Äîcompletely ignoring us‚Äîas if she was serving someone else who wasn‚Äôt even there. She didn‚Äôt greet us, check in, or acknowledge us the entire time.

It got so strange and uncomfortable that I had to finally ask her why she kept serving the empty chairs. I‚Äôve never felt so disrespected in a restaurant.

To make matters worse, when I brought the issue to management, the response was nothing but excuses. No accountability. No apology. Just brushing it off like our experience didn‚Äôt matter.

What hurts the most is that I‚Äôve been coming here since they opened in 1997. But after this, I won‚Äôt be back. I refuse to spend my money somewhere I‚Äôm treated like a second-class citizen. #BoycottCiroPizzeria"

Ciro Pizza Cafe,1.0,"Our family have been loyal patrons of your establishment for two generations. That is why we were both shocked and deeply disappointed by the treatment my 14-year-old daughter and 76-year-old mother-in-law received during a recent visit.

After attending a local game, they stopped by your restaurant to enjoy a meal and ordered one of your pizza specials along with two chicken rolls. To their dismay, they were refused permission to sit outside and eat‚Äînot because seating was unavailable, (it was completely empty)-but because part of their order included a promotional item. Despite the fact that they also ordered full-priced chicken rolls, this arbitrary policy was rigidly enforced.

Adding further insult, one of the chicken rolls was prepared incorrectly. Your staff called after my mother-in-law who was on her way back to her car (after being told they were not allowed to sit outside) to acknowledge the mistake, and once again she politely asked if they could simply sit outside to eat. Incredibly, the answer was still no.

To be clear: your business actively promotes specials to attract customers, yet when customers respond in good faith, they are denied basic hospitality like a place to sit. Is a discount on a pizza pie truly worth alienating long-time, loyal customers‚Äîparticularly when they‚Äôve also ordered additional full-priced items?

This incident does not reflect the values of a neighborhood establishment that claims to serve its community. Your decision to deny a grandmother and her granddaughter a seat over a technicality (especially when ALL the outdoor seating was available) showed a complete disregard for customer loyalty, basic courtesy, and dignity.

If this is how Ciro‚Äôs now chooses to treat its community, then you‚Äôve not only lost our business, but you‚Äôve lost touch with the very people who helped build your success! In a borough full of dining options, we chose you time and again. But No more.

Very disappointed,

Ciro Pizza Cafe,4.0,Food is good. We got a chicken Caesar wraps which was loaded and delicious. We also the Baked Ziti Parm. The baked ziti was good but it need more sauce. Was to dry in my opinion.

Nonna's Pizza Tottenville,5.0,Been in Tottenville for 7 years come from the North Shore this is by far the best pizza on this side
Nonna's Pizza Tottenville,1.0,The gluten free pizza is terrible..dough horrible and not even a piece of basil for taste..its barely edible and wasnt cheap for 8 slices. Came in a tin pan which probably pre-made. If you're gluten free Panini Grill or Tutto Apposto absolute best flavor and toppings..Homeade dough and cannot even taste the difference from regular pizza.

New Island,4.0,"I've been ordering from New Island for many years.  There are closer places but New Islands always been on point.  Food is normally great and delivery time is always fast. Like how did they cook the food, and drive here so quickly fast! The women taking the order and address are always polite and get my street name on the first attempt ( my block name has a lot of similar sounding letters) and the delivery people are always in good spirits and professional. I recommend trying the crab rangoon"

Yosuki Sushi,5.0,"This sushi spot has been my go-to for anything sushi or asian cuisine related. Not only do they make fresh and tasty sushi, their Asian dishes are pretty delicious. Originally my girlfriend and I wanted a quick sushi fix so we tried this place out since it‚Äôs not too far from where we live. Turns out this place is a hidden gem. Staff is very nice and accommodating, atmosphere and environment is clean and aesthetic with great BGM or ambience. I highly recommend the teriyaki chicken or fish if you are looking for a nice rice dish. I am still on a mission to try out all the special rolls on the menu but so far all the rolls have been delicious."

Mike's Place,1.0,"First off the food wasn‚Äôt that great. Definitely not a 4 star diner. Second the service is so poor, I had to wait for so long just to place my order. On top of that the staff is utterly rude and disrespectful especially to people of color. It‚Äôs insane how in this day and age people are this racist. I definitely will not be coming back here and don‚Äôt recommend anyone to come here either. Worst overall in everything."
Mike's Place,1.0,"Disgusting food, hair was everywhere. Also found an ant on my plate‚Ä¶ The interior was dirty and one of the staff sneezed on me. Staff was also EXTREMELY rude and racist.

servers of all time. She gave us a smile and a friendly greeting as soon as we got seated. She was very attentive and a pleasure to be around even with it being short staffed. If all servers were like her everyone would be a whole lot happier. She should be a role model/spoke person to teach everyone how customers should be treated...Thank you mom be being awesome & don't ever change.."
Applebee's Grill + Bar,1.0,"I am so disappointed. I normally dine in and although they are understaffed and it shows the workers are amazing. So I decided to order for third party delivery. I ordered the Tex-Mex Shrimp Bowl which is a favorite of mine. I am so upset. There isn't half the food in this order as at the restaurant. There is almost no rice, I kind you not 4 beans, very little corn and sala. The sauce was far to much for the portion size making the meal Spicer then I prefer. I can honestly say the shrimp looked to be about the same and the lettuce and guac as well. But I was unable to enjoy my overly spiced, basically salad. I was left still hungry due to the portion decrease. I am not even sure i want to eat at this location again if this is how to go orders are handled."
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,"Just had dinner at Applebee's tonight. Daniella was our server and she was very helpful with the menu choices. She was pleasant and definitely a great waitress!  She makes you want to come back, and we will!!!!"
Applebee's Grill + Bar,1.0,"Visited this Apple Bees today. I originally went there to pass some time for an appointment I had set for my dog at Petco. When I walked in I was greeted by a young man who asked me where I would like to sit. Not thinking about it at all & knowing I was by myself I chose the bar because I didn‚Äôt see the reason for me to sit in a booth if I‚Äôm alone. When I got to the bar a young lady came to take my order. While waiting I went off to the bathroom real quick before my order had come. When I came back it took a while to get my food. The young lady was moving around doing other things & I get it. I‚Äôm from New Orleans & worked in the hospitality industry for years before becoming a truck driver & company owner so I understand. But, I noticed the lack of urgency & concern that she had for me while sitting. Mind you I was just there to eat & leave. I literally had a $20-$25 tip with her name on it. But, as time progressed & she was busy tending to other tables without noticing me at all. I had to get my food served by the manager of the restaurant. Ok. I get it. She‚Äôs busy right. Cool. Understandable. But, the problem came in when I literally waited to see if she would notice that I had nothing left to drink & that my other food was taking a while to come out. It took her maybe 10-15 minutes to even acknowledge that I was still waiting. Then when I told her I just needed a refill on my drink (Which was a Pepsi) she continued whatever she was doing. Maybe 5-10 minutes later she asked the Host can he help her real quick. In which the host was actually a pretty good sport. He was the one that actually helped besides the manager. He came through with my food, to go plates & my drink. This young lady didn‚Äôt even try to take payment from me. Which is crazy. Lol. I literally had to ask the host about the payment & he told her afterwards. She finally came over to take payment. In which I paid & although I should have not left her a tip, I did anyways because it just doesn‚Äôt feel right for me to not leave anybody a tip when I‚Äôve worked in this industry for over a decade & know that they pretty much rely on tips for their income. She could have a family at home to feed so, I wasn‚Äôt going to leave nothing. But, I would like for her to know that she missed a good tip being negligent. Sorry for the word if it‚Äôs offensive but, that‚Äôs pretty much the energy she gave me. Meanwhile the food was good & fresh. I appreciate that & also appreciate the host & manager. Big ups to you guys. Probably won‚Äôt be returning to this location because of so much traveling with work. But, overall I‚Äôm disappointed with the bar tender & am happy with the manager, host & food."
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,Ms. Antoinette C was very helpful and polite! Thank you Antoinette.

Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,Really great service
Applebee's Grill + Bar,1.0,"The place is severely understaffed. The staff that is working looks exhausted and stretched thin. It‚Äôs clear management isn‚Äôt investing in proper staffing anymore. The food is bland, sloppily presented, and nowhere near worth the inflated prices they‚Äôre now charging. The drinks are just as bad-watered down, poorly mixed, and wildly overpriced for what you get."
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,"Came for Father‚Äôs Day .. both of my parents are ALOT to handle, and I really appreciated the kindness and patience of our server Ashlee. She made sure  that everything was perfect for them (including getting a new burger for my dad because the one he got had this spicy sauce on it and we didn‚Äôt know it was spicy. He can‚Äôt have spicy food) but Ashlee really took care of perfectly. There was another server helping her (I wish I got her name she was also so kind and helpful)  the food was perfect too! Drinks too!! The bourbon cr√®me martini was amazing!!"

Applebee's Grill + Bar,1.0,This location should just close. They have serious service issues every single time I am here. Waiting an hour and food comes out ice cold is just unacceptable.

Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,"No BS - the time you spend here should exceed all your expectations.  Megan is a delight - I really am seriously going to come back with a few friends over the weekend. Or Cinco de Mayo!!  I've been here a few times and like it here better than other Applebee's.  It's quiet. Not crowded and no wait.  The food is hot and fresh.

Try the artichoke and salsa dip with nachos.

They have these deals, and everyone is worth trying.. the music is just the right volume..

Ok, like I prefer outdoor seating. Kim invited me to sit the outside seating area now that the temperature is warming up for a change of pace.. good decision.

I came primarily for the steaks.  They've got a 2 for $25 offer. Two 6 (or 8) ounce steak entrees, an appetizer, and two sides. You can mix and match as well.

My steak was perfectly cooked as I asked, served on a sizzling hot plate.. nice & hot and without a long wait.

I'll just finish up saying enjoy your visit here- I  know you'll be very happy and as incredibly satisfied as I am with this wonderful  Applebee's!"
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,A few days ago I was on my way into Bj's and an extremely nice Applebees employee convinced me to stop what I was doing and have some delicious food at Applebees!

When I saw the manager I stopped her just to complement Dan and let her know that he really is a hard worker and he would do great for Applebee‚Äôs and attract a lot of positive attention from the customers.

Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,I went to this location last night with my family and we had Megan as our waitress She was the absolute sweetest and she had everything out perfectly we will definitely be going back
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,"Our waitress Maryanna greeted us with a smile and positive attitude offered us new items that were on the menu and followed up to make sure we had everything we needed doing all this while multitasking, tending bar and waiting on tables in a timely manner Definitely will be returning to Applebees because of excellent service we received!"
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,"I had a great experience at Applebee‚Äôs thanks to our waitress, Maryanna. From the moment we sat down, she greeted us with a warm smile and a friendly attitude that made us feel right at home. She was attentive without being overbearing, and she got all of our orders exactly right‚Äîeven with a few custom requests.

Maryanna checked in just the right amount, kept our drinks full, and made great recommendations from the menu. You can tell she really cares about her customers and takes pride in her work. It‚Äôs rare to find service this good, and it definitely made our visit stand out.

If you go to this Applebee‚Äôs, ask for Maryanna‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,"Typical Applebee's food, but service is great; Hope to get Mary Anna, she is wonderful."

Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,Maryanna was the best part of my experience here! She knew the menu and was very kind and made the atmosphere very fun to be in! She deserves 5 stars!!
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,"I come every weekend to sit at the bar with Alexis. Alexis is the best bartender, she‚Äôs funny, personable and good at what she does. This Applebees always treats me good even the servers stop by to say hi to me at the bar like Bri who is just as funny and personable."
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,Want to thank Maryanna the best waitress always goes above and beyond to make our Dinner experiences great! Maryanna is hardworking and always pleasant to Applebees customers! Definitely an asset!
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,"Good wings, fresh hot fries and great service at this location. Mary-Anna‚Äôs service was excellent. Will be requesting her section in the future."

Applebee's Grill + Bar,5.0,"My family and I come here at least 2 to 3 times a month and we love it here! The staff is just fantastic, especially Melody. She makes you feel right at home and takes care of you like you are family."
Kuzina,5.0,<NA>
Kuzina,5.0,The food was so fresh. Ready on time. And nice portions.  So good!!!!!
Kuzina,1.0,"The service here is horrible! When I went to pick up my food, the girl at the counter was incredibly rude. I checked my order and noticed that items were missing. She yelled at me that they didn‚Äôt need my business and told me never to come back. Believe me, I won‚Äôt! The food isn‚Äôt good enough to make up for abusive staff."
Kuzina,1.0,"I have tried this place about 5 different times now just hoping it would get better and it has not even a little. How they charge you an entire dollar for a tiny cup of red wine vinegar is beyond me. No lemon given for the pork and it desperately needs it. I‚Äôve tried the pork gyro, slouvoki and rotisserie and CONSISTENTLY the meat is bone dry like wood as someone else said no matter what kind you get from here. I‚Äôm literally writing this review and only went to look because I had to see that someone else agreed. I don‚Äôt understand how you can have such dry dry food, even the fries are dry. It‚Äôs a shame there‚Äôs not many Greek places on the island and How Greek it is is no longer here. Save your money. Never again. The tzatziki and pita are great depending on the day but once again so over priced for how little tzatziki you get."
Kuzina,5.0,I order from here all the time and recommend them to friends.  Best Greek food around
Kuzina,1.0,"I‚Äôve given this place too many chances and this was the final straw‚Ä¶there was mold on my food! This place cannot get it together. Not only is their delivery  time ridiculous, the food is mediocre and not even good half the time. I wish the island had a different Greek option because this place just sucks all around. Such a shame"
Kuzina,1.0,"Kuzina Kitchen is a ripoff.

I‚Äôve been ordering from Kuzina Kitchen for a long time, but enough is enough. The Greek chicken gyro bowl is overpriced and skimpy‚Äîfeels like they cut up 1 single chicken thigh and tossed it over rice. It's not filling, not worth the price, about $20, and quality has steadily gone downhill.

Today, they forgot part of the order, hummus. I called and was told someone would bring it out. An hour and a half later‚Äînothing. I called again, and they acted like it was the first they were hearing about it. No accountability, no follow-through, and not even a basic apology. I asked for a refund and still got zero acknowledgment that they messed up.

I used to be a regular, but they‚Äôve made it clear they don‚Äôt value repeat customers. Sloppy food, sloppy service. I'm done. I'm avtuwlly mad at myself for ordering from this place as long as I have."
Kuzina,1.0,"Bad customer service
Even the one on Hylan blvd
Ordered multiple times and the orders never come in right and when you try to get the order fixed they will throw you out without a refund all Kuzina need to be closed walked in seen a mouse by the bathroom spoke to the order he said it‚Äôs not my business and to get out place is filthy in the back wouldn‚Äôt order from here anymore with rodents around"
Kuzina,1.0,"It is a shame.  This place could be a good spot but I asked to use their restroom and they said they didn't have one. Curious where the cooks and cashier use the bathroom and wash their hands.  I was not someone off the street.  I was with my family.  The worst part is I went to the taqueria restaurant a few doors down and was denied and told only paying costumers can use their restroom.  A few minutes later the same cashier that told me I couldn't use the bathroom in the taqueria, brought food into Kuzina.  The restaurants must work together so technically I was a paying costumer!  The cashier looked at me and walked right out. He should be ashamed of himself.  I just don't understand how you serve food, have a place to sit and no bathroom for paid costumers.  I will NEVER eat at this place or the Taqueria next door."

Better Gourmet Health Kitchen,5.0,"I eat here for breakfast, lunch or dinner at least once a week for the past few months. Sometimes (most times) 4-5x a week. The food is delicious & the smoothies are perfect. (warning they are addicting) I lost over 25 lbs in 4 months. They really know how to make good food taste good. All of the staff is very friendly and patient with my annoying requests. I would like to specifically thank anna for always being so kind and asking literally every single time how is/was everything making sure my experience stays good. Half the time i forget to ask for a side of honey mustard or barbecue and if she‚Äôs the one taking the order she always remembers to throw one in there. Small things like that will keep a happy customer forever. Thank you all for this amazing establishment!"
Better Gourmet Health Kitchen,5.0,The food and services here are second to none. Anna makes the BEST smoothies!! Everything you order is fresh and the employees are always super friendly and so knowledgeable about their menu items.
Better Gourmet Health Kitchen,5.0,Anna could not be nicer and more helpful! She was so sweet and made sure all my food came out correctly and made sure everything was ok after I was done! She was so professional and a major reason I‚Äôll be ordering from Better Gourmet on Huguenot again.  Thank you Anna you were incredible!!
Better Gourmet Health Kitchen,5.0,"Bro, so good.  Love this place ! Baja bowl is my favorite - jalepenos perfect"
Better Gourmet Health Kitchen,5.0,had such a great wrap here today.  it was giant - was able to take half home.  you can tell the chicken is grilled and def not fried or any oils to make it unhealthy - smoothies are great. they use real fruit not a puree. love this place
Better Gourmet Health Kitchen,5.0,"The food here is so delicious, you do not have to feel bad when you order out! I love that there is a healthy grab and go option right in my neighborhood. The staff here is also great, they are always so friendly and helpful. I highly recommend better! It is a must try."

Panino Rustico of Huguenot Express,5.0,"My first time eating there and I must say I will be a regular customer. I had a panini, grilled chicken Fontaine cheese, avocado. Sun dried tomatoes. It was amazing. So delicious. And the girls behind the counter are so sweet and friendly."
IL FORNO PIZZERIA,5.0,Pizza was very good had one regular slice
IL FORNO PIZZERIA,1.0,This was our go to place every Friday.  We ordered a large pie with toppings and fried calamari.  But this particular Friday my wife wanted shrimp parm heros.  After the delivery the owner calls and says I had to charge you $3 more for the parm. My wife ordered on that slice app. So she tells him it didn't say that on the menu. And we order every Friday night and sometimes other nights also. So he gets a little annoyed at my wife so my wife say by they way the last few times the fried calamari was mushy. So he say well I've been getting alot of complaints about the calamari and I'm gonna take it off the menu. What the hell kind of response is that for an owner. Arguing with my wife when he started the problem. ? Any way he lost a twice weekly customer. We now use AMICI'S PIZZERIA  a block away. Pizza and dinners are the best around. Try them next you will be impressed.  Ilforn's upside down pie is just that.  An upside down mess. Good luck people. Reply to owners post. You are hurting your business yourself. Every order was a roll of the dice.. neighbors feel the same way.this has been building up for quite awhile and we finally just had enough.
IL FORNO PIZZERIA,5.0,<NA>
IL FORNO PIZZERIA,5.0,"I‚Äôve had this pizza twice and its gotta be the most authentic Brooklyn pizza on the island! Best pizza on the island by far. Gotta expand to the north shore, everyone should be able
to have this !!"
IL FORNO PIZZERIA,5.0,"Il Forno is top shelf pizza. Being originally from Brooklyn, I moved out of state to Massachusetts where the pizza is HORRIBLE.
My kids moved to Staten Island where I visit often.
I had my favorite places in Brooklyn,  and would travel back over the bridge to get pizza in Bensonhurst. No longer necessary. Once I discovered this place, I fell in love with a new spot. Owner John is a gentleman and gets all my orders (several pies each trip) ready quickly and accurately. This place should be in Zagat."
IL FORNO PIZZERIA,5.0,Delicious and fantastic service
IL FORNO PIZZERIA,5.0,"Food is TOP SHELF
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG TO START ORDERING FROM THEM. BEATS COMPANIA AND THE REST, HANDS DOWN."

Tejanos Taqueria,3.0,The burritos were so good. Until we pulled 3 hairs out of one! Skeevy!
Tejanos Taqueria,5.0,<NA>
Tejanos Taqueria,1.0,Tacos had no flavor. They looked appealing but were so bland I couldn't eat them.
Tejanos Taqueria,5.0,10/10 quality. Our new favorite spot!
Tejanos Taqueria,5.0,"I ordered the nachos, tacos, soup, and a burrito bowl ‚Äî and everything was absolutely amazing! The nachos were perfectly crisp with just the right amount of toppings. The tacos were packed with flavor and super fresh, and the soup was comforting and well-seasoned. But the real standout was the burrito bowl ‚Äî hearty, delicious, and full of bold flavors. You can tell the ingredients were high quality and made with care. Everything arrived hot and neatly packaged. I‚Äôll definitely be ordering again ‚Äî highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre craving flavorful, satisfying food!"
Tejanos Taqueria,5.0,"The beef nachos were so good ! The tacos were really with the avocado crema. The mexi rice was a little grainy but I would still go back ! The service can be a tad bit better, there wasn‚Äôt any forks or spoon or salsa verde .. this restaurant has really nice vibes .. with some improvement, I think this restaurant has potential. I would recommend"
Reggianos II,4.0,This place is closed. The owner and staff were very nice. Pizza was good.
Reggianos II,1.0,<NA>
Reggianos II,1.0,Can‚Äôt get through anymore.  Todays the worst    Delivery the longest.  I‚Äôm not sure if this is because the other restaurant closed.
Reggianos II,4.0,"Although it took a while to get our dishes, the food was good, though.  It looks like they need more help to serve faster. The grilled sirloin was the favorite. Great portions, good taste."
Reggianos II,5.0,<NA>
Reggianos II,2.0,"No deserts to offer. ""We're waiting for the guy to bring them""  we ordered apps and entr√©es together. When clearing our appetizer plates waiter asked if he should put our entr√©e order in. Waited forever. They did refill the bread basket several times until I said not to bring anymore. Food was OK. Wouldn't go back."
Reggianos II,1.0,"Had my son‚Äôs graduation party. Food was unimpressive, they could not make a decent drink, and we were sweating bullets. The only impressive thing was the check. Definitely not worth the trip."
Reggianos II,1.0,yesterday I ordered a half a tray of chicken cutlets. I ordered at 4:45 and the chicken cutlets did not arrive until 630 when I was trying to call back to cancel because it was taking too long. I kept getting a machine that was hanging up on me when the food arrived. The chicken cutlets were gray inside and stringy no meat to the chicken whatsoever will not be ordering from this establishment again
Reggianos II,5.0,Best place to kick back and enjoy food with some good company...plus the windows are so clean.
Reggianos II,4.0,<NA>
Reggianos II,5.0,Amazing food!  Best server I‚Äôve had in years. Ask for David.
Reggianos II,1.0,"What a shame, food is excellent but the service has been terrible 3 consecutive times eating at this establishment. Held back the first two times, things happen, it can't always be perfect. But this last time I felt bad for my best friends who paid to reserve half the restaurant for a party, only to walk in and find out staff double booked the place. Understaffed at first, tables not arranged according to their original seating chart which the restaurant went over with them several times. Restaurant was 100 degrees but that you could understand because again sometimes you can't control that. Guests for the party were setting up the tables to help get things right. They had to ask and remind them for the cake to be cut and served, and desserts to be served after coffee and drinks were already served. As a parent I was pretty upset that my kids didn't get their food till about an hour 45 mins into the party. We asked the staff what was on the kids menu, we were told chicken fingers and french fries, we said great. That never came out, the rest of the food was being served to everyone else, so then I asked for some plain pasta and sauce for the kids and I was told sure no problem. That food never came. We then asked again about the chicken fingers since the pasta never came, and neither did the chicken.... the same waitor asked us what we ordered for the kids..... after telling us originally what they were serving from the kids menu.
Again, food is excellent, the way the restaurant operates is horrible. Hopefully they can turn things around."
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,4.0,Love their Food. I used to go to Z-One all the Time but they closed . Thank goodness they have a Z-Two

Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere!

We visited Z Two Restaurant & Lounge for a family lunch in June 2025. It was our first time there, though we live nearby. The interior is stylish and inviting, all the food we ordered was excellent, and the service was precise and attentive. It was somewhat pricey but that‚Äôs the tradeoff for higher quality.
We definitely recommend Z Two for great food served in a pleasant, well-designed atmosphere.

Food ordered
Z Two Appetizer Sampler
Chicken Wings with BBQ sauce - excellent
Crock Chili Bowl - excellent chili!
Greek Salad
Steak Fajita - sizzling and flavorful!
Seafood Combo Oreganato
Pistachio Crusted Salmon - salmon is nicely complemented by pistachio crumb crust!
Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna Steak - this one could be a bit more flavorful and less cooked.
Kids Penne Vodka"
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,"Very welcoming, our waiter was fantastic! We came with our two children and they were given little muffins and fruit before we ordered. AMAZING. Very comforting for two hungry toddlers. Anyone traveling/going out with kids can imagine what a huge help that was! The kids menu was great, everyone left full. They were even given balloons on the way out. I rarely leave reviews but this was really special. 5/5, thanks so much!"
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,As always awesome service makes this a great place.
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,Love this place ‚ù§Ô∏è
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,"Had a Tiramisu Latte, which was delicious. I drank some so fast so the picture doesn't do it the justice it deserves... also had chicken tacos, also very good!"
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,"I never really write reviews, but I felt like I had to after our experience here. The food was very good and came out super quick. Our waitress Erin was excellent. The young lady Emma was so welcoming and went out of her way to give us information about their Tuesday and Friday kids night and movie night, which was super helpful since we were looking for something fun to do with our grandkids for the summer. Wonderful atmosphere, the bus boy‚Äôs were even asking us if we needed anything and the gentleman who brought out our food was very friendly. We had a great experience. We'll definitely be coming back!"
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,1.0,"Heard great things about this place. Too bad I didn‚Äôt even sit and eat. Whoever is the older man seating tables needs to greet customers with a smile instead of an attitude. Asked for a table for 8 to celebrate my nephews graduation, and this man proceeded to have an attitude and roll his eyes. When my party made a comment about his attitude, he stated ‚Äúhis face is because there‚Äôs no air conditioning.‚Äù Not sure how this gives a right to take it out on customers. Never again."
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,1.0,"Terrible terrible service!  My family came to celebrate my nieces stepping up to kindergarten. The wait for the food was over an hour. The place was empty when we arrived .. but as it became crowed witness other huge tables full of guest getting their food before us. When I asked what is the problem I was told it‚Äôs busy and brushed off. Food came out freezing cold. Will never come back to Z two for anything. The nerve of me getting an attitude for questioning what‚Äôs going on is ridiculous, especially for the amount of patience my family showed today. To offer us a free desert is tasteless for the two hours we sat in there just to be serve cold food and attitude. Do not recommend."
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,1.0,"Waitress was great! No issues with that. We were a party of 7. Half the food came out either over cooked or undercooked. The bus boy that brought our food out had no
Idea what he was giving us. Several different types of steaks were ordered all with different cooking temps and he just had no clue. Only after about 5 min of standing there with our hot food plates did we all get our correct plates. The $32 NY steak I ordered was just a ridiculously thick hunk of fat. There was just nothing that could be done with that steak. And at this point I‚Äôve lost my appetite. I ask
The waitress to please just take it away. I‚Äôm not interested in a replacement. My daughter‚Äôs steak and eggs were just too well done. Her boyfriends steak was practically raw, asked for medium
Rare. Her father‚Äôs cheeseburger came out practically raw in the middle. But they decided to just eat what they could. Come time
For the bill and unfortunately my Inedible steak was not removed from the bill. I didn‚Äôt make a stink. Paid it in full, gave the waitress a very nice tip and left. I would never eat there again. For a $300 bill, half the food was cooked incorrectly. The piece of steak I was given clearly looked gross. Yet they served it to me anyway. No thank you!"
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,"I've gone multiple times and have been very satisfied with my meal. I love pancakes and they have very well done pancakes that make me happy I chose to go there. The environment doesn't have too much going on and the waiters or waitresses have been respectful and haven't felt too busy or gone too long. Food was hot everytime it came out. I can admit I've had only a bunch of breakfast items and they all were worth it. I would have to explore the lunch and dinner menu, but with their track record I can assume it will be up to my expectations and if it wasn't, the management would do the best to accommodate me. Check out Z two."
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,4.0,Better than expected!  They stepped up the decor and service
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,Place is good food fresh play is clean waiters so friendly and believable plenty of parking space
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,Always excellent
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,1.0,"What's not to love ? They have "" Drag/Fag Bingo"" night where men wear dresses with big bulges protruding from their dresses (not money).. Don't worry, the manager of Z2 assures us that this is all normal and that we've been wrong about our fear and that we should be more understanding to men who take it up the Heiny ! I don't know about you but I don't want to have "" Big Louie & Huge Connie"" sharing a restroom with our 7 year old child !!!"
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,We came here for a late date night. It was not part of our plans but turned out great! The service was excellent! Food excellent we had 2 for 20 burger and fries and a shot of vodka lol. Our server was great. Very attentive and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. The atmosphere was chill and I was impressed with the cleanliness. Also worth noting they are one of the only restaurants serving food after 10pm on the south shore. Check them out! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,"Relaxing atmosphereüíã, great service‚ù§Ô∏è, delicious food and  good happy hour from 3pm-7pm!! üç∏üçπüç∫"
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,5.0,"I love the folks here-  So much so that I often come with a small group.. Inviting friends is something of a regular thing with me..

I grew up in diners.. this is the best dinner lounge/with more than just restaurant-diner food. It's a culinary delight!

Their Dinner specials change daily.. Steve and staff, Phil the nicest manager, everyone here is incredible.

The mushroom soup is a great starter.   Angie was our server tonight.. music is terrific always. Live music & dancing many summer weekends. Lively outdoor area as well with a bar area/lounge.

The restaurant is best known for their steaks and chops.  The mouth-watering aromas outside attest to this.   Cooked to perfection and absolutely fresh, & never frozen. My steaks always melt in my mouth.

The T-bone and shrimp special was my go-to as usual tonight..  The steak was huge just like the jumbo shrimp. You have never tasted anythingso delicious. Also- their eggplant parmigiana was so delicious and fresh served with a perfect situation and a beautifully light tomato sauce. And huge portions!

Don't know how else to say 5 stars isn't nearly enough! Thank you for all the great meals Z- Two.  A great place to celebrate any occasion- Happy Mothers Day!"
Z-Two Restaurant & Lounge,2.0,"Ordered a steak and eggs breakfast and a Turkey BLT costed me $100. They charged me 60$ for a steak, 2 eggs over easy and fries‚Ä¶. First and last time going , Out of line never going back. Last night my wife and I  went out to dinner and had a full course dinner for $120‚Ä¶"

Nature's Grill Staten Island,2.0,"Not sure what is going on with this place. Every time we order the food is good but the delivery takes so long. This time the delivery was over two hours. We called a couple of times to see where the food was and they told us five minutes, but then 30 minutes passed. Then I called to receive a refund and said that I did not want the food anymore because I‚Äôm sure it was cooked well over two hours ago at this point. They told me they will tell the driver to not come and give me a refund being super dismissive. I think It‚Äôs just terrible customer service, the food should have been sent, credited, and with an apology. Now I‚Äôll never order from a place I enjoyed. Sucks"
Nature's Grill Staten Island,5.0,"Simple food expertly prepared with quality ingredients, served with a smile"
Nature's Grill Staten Island,1.0,"I placed an order for a juice, sandwich, and fries, and had a terrible experience. Three different DoorDash drivers told me my food wasn‚Äôt ready, and after waiting 90 minutes, I had to cancel my order because I needed to leave for work. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had issues with long wait times using DoorDash. Very disappointing and unreliable service.

Nature's Grill Staten Island,1.0,I ordered food here. I parked in the parking space. The idiot owner broke my license plate. He didn't apologize and cancelled my order. Really rubbish service.
Nature's Grill Staten Island,3.0,I got a cesar salad and the salad itself looked good but the dressing‚Äîit was surprisingly awful. I do not know what kind of dressing they use but it is terrible. It looked strange in the cup like gelatinous & the taste was so gross. It must be an extremely cheap random brand or spoilt? This place seemed pretty awesome‚Äîit looks nice and the idea of quality healthy food is perfect.
Nature's Grill Staten Island,5.0,Taste of china is my go to from here. I don‚Äôt know how they make their broccoli but it‚Äôs the only broccoli i can eat. 10/10

Breaking Bread,4.0,Waiters? So angry! I have eaten here a bunch of times over the past few years. Refuse to dine in unless we sit at the bar. Food is great. Please get new waiters
Breaking Bread,1.0,"It‚Äôs so unfortunate bc the pizza is fantastic (nice job Giuseppe) but the owners have such a bad attitude, mainly the wife. So unwelcoming to say the least. You can be a regular and they do not say hello or goodbye, won‚Äôt even acknowledge you at the bar, very bad attitude. If someone is spending money repeatedly at your business the least you can do is show a little bit of class. That‚Äôs okay off my big family and I go to another pizza joint.. luckily on Staten Island there‚Äôs one on every corner."
Breaking Bread,1.0,Food is mediocre service is rude way over priced. If you want Italian food in the neighborhood Eat italian or Rocky's is great.
Breaking Bread,5.0,Had their food catered to a team dinner with middle school children and adults.  The food was delicious! Ordering was a breeze.  Nicole helped me through the process etc. If I didn't want to be 500 lbs I would eat there every day. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Millie's of Staten Island,2.0,The service was good...I was told they were famous for their meatballs...I had a meatball hero and was really disappointed....they didn't taste good at all and they were kinda hard...
Millie's of Staten Island,3.0,"For a first vist I was underwhelemed.  Food was a step above an Olive Garden and I've only been there once too.  Egglplant parm dinner was cold in the center and parts were soft and mushy, other parts were undercooked and harder. Mozzarella and prosciutto hero was something you could have made at home or gotten from any italian deli.  Vodka dipping sauce tasted like it was from a jar.  I gave the 2 stars for an decent burger but nothing outstanding.  Server was the best part of the experience.  She was sweet and attentive.  Will not be going back."
Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,Hands down the best steak on all of Staten Island  a must try NYC steak house quality for the price you cannot beat it . Love this place and all the food and drinks
Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,Best meatballs and happy hour bar menu
Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,"We decided to stop at Millie‚Äôs in Staten Island
( Bricktown) after shopping.  We were served by Jason ! He was PHENOMENAL!!! So attentive and friendly! We haven‚Äôt experienced service like that in such a long time. We felt so comfortable!!! Thank you Jason üôèüèº Food was absolutely delicious : from app to iced espresso at Jason‚Äôs recommendation! Absolutely Perfect ! Btwn service ( Jason) and food,  we will be going on a regular basis.  Menu has so much to choose from and everything looks amazing: not the usual everyday items ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Millie's of Staten Island,1.0,Went today was excited about menu food was cold asked staff for help was giving none. Pretty bummed out thought pizza in Jersey would be good!
Millie's of Staten Island,2.0,"Me and my wife went here for date night.   We each ordered a drink, which came out on time.   We ordered a pizza with no mushrooms, and the veal Milanese with salad.    They brought out a pizza with mushrooms on it, and then brought out veal parmesan with linguine, so they messed up both things we ordered.   We decided it was all good and we wouldn‚Äôt send anything back, but we did tell our waiter.    We ordered a second round of drinks around 7:45.   Around 8:05, the waiter came back to us finally, and asked if we needed anything else.    We said we hadn‚Äôt received our drinks.   He apologized and said they‚Äôd be right out, and I requested the check.   He returned with no drinks and only the check.   We never got them.   Unfortunately they completely messed up 3/4 things we ordered.   The food was good but we were disappointed."
Millie's of Staten Island,1.0,"I ordered take out. These mozzarella sticks are definitely not worth $14. Further, the perfume smell blanketed on the ag and tinfoil was overwhelming. It's as if it was sprayed over this food ""I say loosely."""
Millie's of Staten Island,3.0,"We have been here 6 times in the last few months. The Food has been pretty good but the service is hit or miss. Just me and my wife, party of two, and if there is a larger table in the room the wait staff will ignore you. If its mostly 2 tops service seems decent, not exactly great but decent. When larger parties are there,  your invisible. Had to get up more then once to find who I think is the manager to get our waiter, or to give us the check. One time after the tables seemed re-arranged, a male waiter, young with black curly hair kept banging into our chairs and table.  Staff is pretty young and doesn't seem to experienced. Too bad, pizza and salad are very good."
Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,Good food and good service
Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,The bartenders and wait staff are awesome.
Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,"Always have a good meal here, live the pizza. Also you can have a great steak ü•© too!!! Bar staff is always friendly!!!"
Millie's of Staten Island,3.0,"The meatballs were excellent, but the lamb chops and steaks were overcooked. The manager saw that the steak was overcooked, brought it to our table anyway, and offered to take it back, but in my opinion, he should not have asked and just did so. It was pricey, so I expected exceptional food preparation. They did give us a combo platter of all their desserts free."
Millie's of Staten Island,4.0,It's  a pretty  good  restaurant  I  love  their pizza. You should  go there. I highly recommend it
Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,Very good food like home cooking would recommend known for there steaks but meatballs are amazing
Millie's of Staten Island,4.0,"I was here last night for very first time. I loved the atmosphere and the food was great.  Above all, Dolores , the bartender was awesome! The best ever. She made you feel comfortable right away. I've been to alot of bars, Manhattan,  Bklyn, Bay Ridge, etc. she blew them all away! Thank you Dolores üòä"
Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,What an awesome place and experience..the food was amazing and the staff professional and very attending..If I could rate this place higher I would...everything was top quality.. what I admired the most about this restaurant is they really made you feel like family..and many of the staff were actually family..this means a lot to me..very rare to see such love and dedication and structure ..
Millie's of Staten Island,1.0,Waited 20 minutes to get a water and seltzer. The place wasn‚Äôt even busy - just to be told that our waiter got ‚Äúcaught up‚Äù meanwhile he was standing around talking to other waiters. Another waitress comes after the 20 minutes and says she will be our waitress - didn‚Äôt even bring the drinks with her when she said she had the drink order‚Ä¶. first and last time here.

Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,Amazing food and service! The porterhouse for 2 is phenomenal!
Millie's of Staten Island,3.0,Came for a steak left with a heart break. Been coming here for the past 2 years for 24 oz ribeye came with a salad and 2 sides for $65. It is now $75 for just one side and no salad . Each additional side is $15 now . I didn‚Äôt order the steak this time because of these changes and I love a steak very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è.

Millie's of Staten Island,4.0,<NA>
Millie's of Staten Island,5.0,"We ordered the meatballs with marinara and mozzarella for the appetizer and was very pleased with, how flavorful the sauce was. The eggplant entree was also very tasty with a rich thick sauce. We also had a coal-fired small (6 slice bar pie)  pepperoni pizza. Very crispy and delicious crust.  Definitely will be back.
Sorry I didn't get pics, left the phone in the truck again."
Millie's of Staten Island,4.0,"The food here is delicious.  I've been a few times, and it's been consistent.

Trattoria Toscana,3.0,The food is ok. Not much of a comment but just averge.
Trattoria Toscana,4.0,"Attended a private party here. Service and ambiance were spot on. The food was a little disappointing, salmon and pork chop were both dry."
Trattoria Toscana,5.0,<NA>
Trattoria Toscana,5.0,"In my opinion, this is truly the BEST restaurant on Staten Island.  It blows away some of the finest steakhouses in the world. They also make their own fresh pasta and bread daily.  The staff goes above and beyond always to ensure your pleasure.

They have the most ‚ù§Ô∏è BEAUTIFUL ‚ù§Ô∏è party room too & host wonderful events/experiences.

If you need a GUARANTEED greatly successful meal/date/party/family gathering/wedding -
Trattoria Toscana is your best choice."

Trattoria Toscana,1.0,"Terrible !!! Spaghetti With Chicken Cutlet Parmagian Was Awful.Chicken Cutlet Was Hard & Spaghetti Was Mushy.My Son Ordered Branzino D Something Involving Fish.Was Good Until He Found A Long Hair In This Dish ! Owner Would Not Come Over To The Table, I Had To Speak Up Numerous Times Before He Came Over. His Name Was Adrian .Very Nice, Very Polite.He Appologized And Sent Me A Dish Of Chicken Marsala. Did Not Even Offer To Replace My Sons Dish With The Hair In It ! I Also Ordered The Filet Mignon To Go.When I Received The Bill I Couldn't Believe It.They Charged Me For My Sons Dish With The Hair In It !! I Could Not Believe It ! And They Charged Me For The Chicken Parm !!! That Was Terrible !!!! And Handed Us A Shot Of Liquor And APieceCheese"
Trattoria Toscana,3.0,"Calamari was chewy.  The rest of the meal was OK.  Service was slow, and the restaurant was almost empty.   Could be because it was a Monday."
Trattoria Toscana,2.0,"It was a very unpleasant dinning experience. the food was ok but the waiter that serve us was very rude and arrogant. He can careless about service, gave us the dirty plate and wilted lime; and when we tried to order, he just came up to ask ""are you guys ready to order? "" without introducing himself, we didn't get his name or any greeting at all!
When I asked for suggestions, he did not mention any specials, just told us ""you can do it the Italian way, just order pasta first and then have the entree""
we ordered some appetizer, grill salmon and the lamb chop; I told him that I try to limited carbs, and I would like to order more protein dishes. but he just keep repeating the something about ""do it the Italian way, order the pasta first"".
He repeated it at lest 3 times even after I told him I'm not trying to get carbs. I don't understand why he tried to sell the pasta so badly, but instead of saying ""how good the pasta is, and worth a try"", he keep telling us to ""do it the Italian way"". that's very unprofessional and very poor selling/service skill. I wish he told us about the tomahawk steak, I saw our next table had it and it smells really good. the grill salmon that we got was ok, farm rise salmon so had enough fat in it, was not dry. but wish he told us what sauce it came with. the lamb chop was pretty tender, did grilled to the medium-rare that I asked for.
Overall, the food was ok; location just alright; it's by Hyland Blvd, so it's kind of noisy and no view. however, the service was the worst part. It's the most unwelcoming Italian restarting that I've even been to. I always think they're very passionate and friendly. I guess it's just one bad apple. I'm sure there're more good restaurants with friendly staff on the Island."
Trattoria Toscana,5.0,Very nice atmosphere but can be loud at times. Food is always good and service is also good. I was annoyed by the valet insisting that he park my truck after I already pulled into the handicap space. When we left the truck was parked at the end of the lot and a non handicap permit jeep was in the handicap space!
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,Went there for a private party everything was excellent friendly service excellent food and it was a private party. It was special occasion. Enjoyed it very much.
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,Excellent!!!!  Service was on point.  Attentive but also gave us time to talk and enjoy our dinner.  Can't say enough about the food from appetizers to dessert everything was absolutely delicious.
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,"What a gem of a place. We stumbled across here just looking for a quick bite to eat.  What a surprise, it was so much more than that. Great food, great service and a great ambience. It was a real dining experience. Had a good fixed price menu too. Best restaurant we‚Äôve been in since arriving in the US three months ago."
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,Had a nice relaxing dinner with family. So glad that we came. Service was excellent and the food was delicious
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,Went to Gulianas  on Thursday with a large group  As usual the food was excellent as was the service and also  the music by beautiful Teresa I would highly recommend Gulianas for dinner especially with large parties you  won‚Äôt be disappointed Again shout out to Robert Chris and Teresa for making our night great Thank you
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,"Always a good time. . . Food is good, staff is friendly, back rooms are great for small groups"
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,The food was awesome.  The staff was friendly and attentive. There was a good time had by all.
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,Dinned this evening at Giuliana's and it continues to give superior service and excellent food with amazing flavours each time I go.  I brought a friend who had not been before and she loved it. Also special mention that our server Ailan was amazing and very knowledgeable about all the food and drinks on the menu and Maggie our other server  is a credit to the staff-  - they were both very personable and without them the evening would not have been the same.  I highly recommend this restaurant and would suggest you make reservations because on a Tuesday evening it was full and everyone was having a great time. Again the food is consistently out of this world -
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,"10/10 this pizza was delicious, one of the best ive ever had."
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,We had my daughter‚Äòs baby shower there and it was beautiful.  Everyone had a great timeüå∏üôå
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,2.0,"The place was very nice had an old school Italian feel to it but the service was horrible, we waited for almost an hour to just get our orders taken, there was a couple who walked in after us and got all the attention and were out way before we were. I understand having regulars but when you have a group of 7 waiting a while to even get there orders put in is crazy, the food was good but definitely not the best Italian food I‚Äôve had, the lady who was pouring water into our cups had a nasty attitude like she hated her job and we were bothering her, my sisters mother in law asked for a few things and they kept saying they didn‚Äôt have it, our waiter was nice but I constantly saw them sitting at a table with another group and the owner didn‚Äôt check on us until she didn‚Äôt have to play nice to the party that was in the main dining area. Will definitely be taking my business elsewhere, the food is insanely overpriced for basic mediocre Italian food."

Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,Fantastic all around.
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,"We were a group of four and each of us ordered from the prix-fixed menu. There was a great selection to choose from, each dish was delicious."
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,Haven't been here for a long time just because we forgot about it. Glad we went back. Food and service was excellent . Fried calamari and the hot antipasto appetizers started the meal on a high note. Salmon over spinach and shrimp was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. Filet of sole oreganata prepared and tasted amazing.   We don't usually have dessert but we opted for tartufo and Italian cheesecake with cappuccino to finish the meal and we were glad we did. Excellent!
Giuliana‚Äôs Ristorante,5.0,We had a delicious dinner and the service was fantastic.  Next time I‚Äôm visiting the island I will surely eat at Guiliana‚Äôs
Cucumber Sushi & Salad Bar,1.0,"Today, after buying rolls and drinking, I felt very ill. I was poisoned. I'm sure it was because of the food, as I had previously eaten something I had prepared myself. It's no exaggeration to say that I was disappointed. I'm glad that my child refused to eat them."

Cucumber Sushi & Salad Bar,3.0,I placed a delivery order and although the experience placing the order was perfect and the delivery was fast . The delivery driver was a bit rude. Upon arrival he called me in tizzy saying that he was outside and rushing me. I said to him stay there I‚Äôll be right now and he‚Äôs response was saying in a rude tone tik tok . This is the second time I order from them and receive some annoyance on the delivery end. I wish their drivers were more approachable and friendly.

Andrew‚Äôs Diner,1.0,Repulsive food. Sub average service. I have no idea what people are talking about.
Andrew‚Äôs Diner,5.0,"Andrew's Diner is a great spot on Hylan Blvd! I had the vegetable egg white omelet with home fries and it was delicious‚Äîfresh, flavorful, and cooked just right. The staff were friendly and the service was quick. The diner itself has a welcoming, classic atmosphere that‚Äôs perfect for a relaxed meal.

If you‚Äôre in the area, I definitely recommend stopping by for breakfast or any meal. You can find them at 4160 Hylan Blvd, Staten Island, NY 10308"

Andrew‚Äôs Diner,5.0,"Ah, what a wonderful diner. The menu is plentiful and offers something for anyone of size, shape, or appetite. I had a nice Mediterranean plate and I was stuffed. I definitely liked the plentiful vegan options."
Andrew‚Äôs Diner,4.0,A large selection on the menu is always great. Fair prices and a small parking lot is available. Very family friendly
Andrew‚Äôs Diner,5.0,100% Best Pastrami on Staten Island Hands Down!
Andrew‚Äôs Diner,4.0,"I've only been to Staten Island a couple of times, but Andrew's Diner always delivers that classic diner vibe. Both visits were super busy, yet we walked right in‚Äîno wait! The portions are huge, seriously, I can never finish everything.
One time, I had waffles with turkey sausage and scrambled eggs. Those waffles were perfect: crispy outside, fluffy inside. They even had sugar-free syrup when I asked, which was great. Another time, I tried the pastrami omelette, and wow, it was massive! Easily enough for more than 1 person, especially with the side of home fries.
Next time I'm in Staten Island, I'm definitely hitting up Andrew's Diner for breakfast."
Andrew‚Äôs Diner,4.0,Believe it or notThey got awesome pastrami their soups are good also
Andrew‚Äôs Diner,5.0,"This diner never disappoints. Normally don't get steak in a diner but I went with my gut (and stomach) and got a New York strip streak. Freaking outrageous! Came with broccoli, sweet potato and a salad. Blue moon beer for my liquid. Also came with dessert (cheese cake to go). Thank you to management for the extra slices of pie on the way out for my birthday. See you soon for breakfast."

Andrew‚Äôs Diner,5.0,"I‚Äôm a professional videographer and I travel to various places across the United States, filming and often dining at different establishments.

I highly recommend this place ‚Äî it‚Äôs impeccable, with flawless service and great prices."
Andrew‚Äôs Diner,5.0,"Amazing people, Food, Catolog, and environment. We had an older gentleman come over and preform magic trick for us out of the kindness of his heart which really made our day, we‚Äôve been there twice and it‚Äôs been amazing both times. 100% recommend!"

Andrew‚Äôs Diner,3.0,"Went here on Good Friday 2025 for breakfast. Chose this since it had high ratings and we were visiting Staten Island. It‚Äôs a regular diner. Nothing fancy but it works. Good menu selection. I liked the vegetable omelette. My husband was not thrilled about the eggs benedict with salmon and expected better taste. I expected better waffles somehow. Not great but decent food. Seems like many locals come here. Decent service. Their restaurant signage could use some repair. Since parking was limited, you can opt for street parking."
Andrew‚Äôs Diner,3.0,This is a quiet and sleepy diner. That isn‚Äôt an insult‚Ä¶ love places like this but they need a little background music or something. Food was your typical diner fare. Loved the muffin and omelette. Can‚Äôt go wrong with the comfort food here. Food comes out hot and fast.

Hong Kong Kei One,3.0,"I got the Singapore Mei Fun and the portions were good and the shrimp and chicken to noodle ratio was good. However, the chicken was completely tasteless even though it‚Äôs a curry noodle. I understand they cook the chicken separately but at least boil it in some salt. It was really hard to eat the chicken. The noodles didn‚Äôt have much curry flavor even though they were very yellow. Very disappointed since everyone usually sings their praises about this restaurant."
Hong Kong Kei One,5.0,Food is great.

Best Western Queens Gold Coast,3.0,"Rooms are decent and clean. If you hv more than two people in this  room with two full size beds, it is tight. One small sink & bathroom. Price is expensive for that. If you dont get there early for breakfast you are out of luck with the food. Limited space to sit & eat with family."
Best Western Queens Gold Coast,5.0,<NA>
Best Western Queens Gold Coast,5.0,"Of the 3 hotels that I stayed at recently, this was my favorite.The location of the hotel is ideal for visiting a loved one at Ozanam Nursing Home of Queens. Right across street from front of hotel is a Wendy's and Burger King, Popeye's and Dunkin' Donuts are less than a block away. Location of hotel is safe and they have free parking. The great complimentary breakfast includes big fresh waffles (waffle maker) that come with choices of syrup and compote, plain scrabbled eggs, scrabbled eggs w/ veggies and cheese, and breakfast meat varies by day (bacon, turkey hash, breakfast sausage patties...). There are small breakfast pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, breads, juices and coffee. In the lobby there is an awesome coffee machine that will make an espresso, vanilla latte and several other choices at the touch of a button. When we arrived, we were each handed snack bags of assorted chips, a snack bar, bottled water. Staff was friendly and professional and I felt at home. There is a restaurant off the lobby where I enjoyed chicken parmigiana and husband enjoyed chicken cordon bleu. Our room window faced out the back of hotel (odd numbered units) and I enjoyed the view which included nice homes and a part of the bay beyond. The room contained 2 chairs which makes good sense if there are 2 occupants; other hotel units elsewhere often only have 1 chair. The sheets and bathroom were clean which is the MOST important!  The room includes both a small fridge, a microwave and a pod-style coffee maker. I like that the sink is outside the bathroom. There is a park about 5 blocks away called Alley  Pond Park that had a walking path around Oakland Lake. The small lake has two swans that are nesting, turtles (basking together in the sun) and ducks. Although the age of hotel may be the complaint of some reviewers, it did not deter from us returning to stay an additional 3 times for its warmth, comfort and cleanliness. As a reward member (free) you can get a lower rate by prepaying and selecting a non-refundable advanced rate.
Thank you to all staff!"

Best Western Queens Gold Coast,5.0,Good experience.  We were there for only one night. It seems like an old building that has been renovated. Good food and people.
Best Western Queens Gold Coast,4.0,"Although traveling to this location took longer from the airport than expected (30 mins +/-), the front desk receptionist was wonderful. Overall, my one-night stay was quite pleasant."
Best Western Queens Gold Coast,1.0,"I booked a 4-night stay, but the experience was unacceptable from the start. On the first night, the room lights wouldn‚Äôt turn off, making it impossible to sleep. I was moved to another room the next day, but the bathtub there was completely clogged.
I left a note for maintenance and went out, but when I returned, nothing had been fixed, and the room hadn‚Äôt been cleaned.

I repeatedly asked the front desk receptionist, Matthew, for help. He was dismissive, rude, and unprofessional. Eventually, a technician arrived but said the issue couldn‚Äôt be fixed. When I asked to change rooms again, Matthew said there were no available rooms and told me to go stay at another hotel.

Matthew‚Äôs behavior was shocking‚Äîhe refused to help, raised his voice at me in front of my child, and even threatened to call the police. Moments after claiming he couldn‚Äôt leave the desk, but I left, and I saw him outside smoking. His behavior was unprofessional, irresponsible, and completely inappropriate for someone in a customer-facing role.

Between the unresolved maintenance issues and the staff's unacceptable conduct, this stay was a nightmare. I strongly advise against staying at this hotel."
Best Western Queens Gold Coast,4.0,"My family stayed here for a long weekend to attend a few family functions . The location is near a few fast food restaurants and the hotel itself is attached to a restaurant ( we didn‚Äôt get a chance to try it ). Free on site parking; first come first serve. Hot breakfast was great. The room was small, but it‚Äôs NY ( you can‚Äôt expect large rooms). Smart tv, mini fridge, and microwave in the room. That was really helpful ! The bathroom tub could use a little TLC like tub glazing and cracked floor tile. The double beds are pretty small ( it‚Äôs more of a full size bed than a queen size), USB ports in the rooms would have been helpful too. Other than that we enjoyed our stay and would stay again!"
Best Western Queens Gold Coast,4.0,El hotel esta a 45 minutos del aereopuerto. Los cuartos estan limpios. Se observa que es antiguo . La comida y la atencion del servicio del restaurante es muy buena

‚ÄòO Sfizio Ristorante,5.0,"Osfizio is always a favorite...Food, drinks and dessert are always wonderful,  but the best part of the evening is, without a doubt, the  enthusiasm of our favorite manager, Gennaro! He's the best!!!

‚ÄòO Sfizio Ristorante,5.0,This place is absolutely the best Italian restaurant I have been. The food is outstanding without fail. Me and the wife had the arrabiata and it was to die for. The ribeye steak was sooo good too. The service is amazing and very friendly. Worth every penny.

‚ÄòO Sfizio Ristorante,5.0,Cannot say enough took daughter there for birthday everything was top notch food was delicious did not have to ask for a thing server was there with anything that the table needed.

‚ÄòO Sfizio Ristorante,5.0,"I enjoy the food here from
The little I‚Äôve tried but I plan to make a far more accurate assessment edit in the future. Thus far quality traditional Italian service, quality ingredients.  Straight up Italian restaurant as if I was in the heart of Rome but that comes with a grain of salt if you‚Äôve ever been.  It is a place you need to try without a question. You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
‚ÄòO Sfizio Ristorante,5.0,The Sunday sauce is amazing. Pizza is on point. They're gonna be a staple in the neighborhood for a long time.

The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,"Always expect an absolutely wonderful experience at The Old Bermuda Inn! The food is incredible with so many delicious options to choose from, and the service is just as impressive. The staff is kind, attentive, and makes everyone feel welcome. Special shout out to the team at the booking office‚Äîthey are so helpful and flexible every step of the way. Highly recommend for any special occasion!"
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,1.0,"I would run, not walk, away from this place. It is horrendous. The old, rundown establishment has outdated service and terrible food that is often overcooked. Having worked in this industry for a long time, I can confidently say that this place deserves to be on a list of the most unpleasant dining experiences. I would rather host a pizza party than dine at the Old Bermuda Inn, which uses plastic pitchers to serve drinks at the bar.

Additionally, the bartender left the bar unattended for over half an hour, leaving a sign that said he'd be back soon. I had to go searching for staff just to get assistance. I would never consider booking a party here. It's simply disappointing!"
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,<NA>
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,"I don‚Äôt know where to start. I wish I could give them more than 10 stars, because they deserve 11+. If you are thinking about having a party, big or small, Old Bermuda Inn is your place. They are AMAZING!! The food is phenomenal and delicious. The service and the staff, especially Estephania (always my #1 girl), Joanie (thank you for coming back to work my party), Bill, Gabriel and Greg are impeccable. They go above and beyond; always behind you knowing what your next move is or bringing you a drink before you ask for it.
And lastly, but definitely not least, I can never thank Cindy, the manager, enough for all the time, planning, creativity and patience she gave me and my family while planning my daughter‚Äôs sweet 16. She went WAY above and beyond to make my party a huge success. From having all my daughters favorite foods, specifically sushi, calling me with ideas for my vision, coming up with new ideas such as a ""ring the bell"" for a VIP drink pass wall, to specialty food stations at cocktail hour, to milk and cookies on the dance floor to end the night. My party was a huge success. For days now, I‚Äôve received numerous texts and calls from many of my 200+ guests telling me how delicious the food was and how amazing the service was and what an amazing party it was. And seeing my daughter run over to you and give you a big hug, that for me is #1 and says it all. Thank you!! I've had numerous parties here for over 15 years now, from christenings, 1st bdays, communions, graduations, sweet 16‚Äôs and I can honestly say, they out do themselves with each party."
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,I did not stay here but came for their Sunday breakfast buffet with my friends and just loved it. The food is delicious and not just breakfast food. The service is also great. Highly recommend.
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,1.0,"I recently visited The Old Bermuda Inn and was extremely disappointed with the service I received from the ma√Ætre d‚Äô, Estephiana. She was shockingly rude, unprofessional, and completely disrespectful. From the moment we arrived, her attitude was dismissive and unpleasant, making what should have been a nice occasion feel uncomfortable.

Hospitality is about making guests feel welcome, but Estephiana‚Äôs behavior was the exact opposite. It‚Äôs disappointing that such a beautiful venue would allow someone with such a nasty attitude to represent them at the front. I will not be returning and cannot recommend this establishment based on my experience."
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,"My daughter had her engagement party here a few weeks ago.  Everyone- and I mean everyone - was wonderful and truly a pleasure to work with.  From Mike who sat with her to get it all on the calendar and get the ball rolling to all the individuals who were preparing the room when we arrived to start getting all the decorations up and all.  Tara supervised all the servers and made sure they were on top of everything - and they were.  Shout out to server Madison (sweet girl).  And, the food was *absolutely* delicious!
Thank you Mike, Laurie, Cindy and Josephine.  All of you made her party a success.  You were all a pleasure to deal with and she was very happy with how it all went.  She sends you many thanks!
Anyone thinking of hosting a party should definitely consider The Historic Old Bermuda Inn.  You'll be happy you did."

The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,"I can't attest to their rooms as I didn't stay overnight. My long time friend and I went to the Old Bermuda for the Sunday Brunch. Brunch was very well presented. There were breads, pastries, eggs, bacon, sausage, prime rib, ham, homefries, French toast and pancakes just to name a few. I was highly impressed. The decor was very nice. This Inn is very well cared for. Service was impeccable. I will definitely return and would like to try the bed and breakfast."
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,Went to a luncheon. Food was amazing. Very beautiful decor.
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,Great place went there for Easter buffet style was really good
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,Michelle M and Ryan were kind attentive and simply great to have. I will return because of the service they provide. The food was good too!
The Historic Old Bermuda Inn,5.0,"I love their Sunday brunch!  We have been here for the regular Sunday brunch which is always very nice with a good selection, but their Easter Brunch was absolutely the BEST!  The food was phenomenal with a great selection - skirt steak-yum, pepper steak-the best, eggplant parmigiana-wonderful, sausage and peppers, etc.
But the best was when the Easter Bunny came in.  He went to each table, posed for pics, had eggs (with I guess a toy inside) for all the children, and what truly impressed me, a lady who had a little difficulty walking, the Easter Bunny happily escorted her back down the steps and to her seat after she had posed for a pic with him!
These people made it a wonderfully enjoyable Easter for all their guests.
To all the staff-thank you for all your hard work."

Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"Our stay was great! Perfect location with lots of options for shopping and great food. Our room specifically was a bit small for our family of four, since the bed size was double vs queen. But otherwise, the room and shared spaces were very clean and the staff was very friendly."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"I attended an all day AAA Defensive Driving Course. Friendly staff, clean meeting room & bathroom. Free water provided.  Free on site parking."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"After a long day with flight cancellations me and my family arrived at jfk very tired.
We called like 20 different hotels they were all sold out.
Adria was the first that tried to be helpful and called different locations to find one with rooms available.

Victor specifically went above and beyond, he could tell we were exhausted and was very accommodating."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"I had a really good stay at this hotel! I want to say a big thank you to Victor at the front desk. He helped me a lot and was very friendly, even late at night. He did his job with great energy and made me feel welcome. Thank you, Victor!"
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,4.0,"I stayed in a room for an event I hosted at Adria. The room was clean and comfortable, the ballroom was decorated beautifully, the coordinator was very helpful and the staff was great with the exception of 1 rude bartender."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,We had a very pleasant stay. The room could have been more updated but it was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Free parking was available which is a rarely in NYC. The location is convenient and easy accessible to the major highways. The staff was very helpful and polite. Haroon checked us in and was attentive to our needs. I highly recommend this hotel.
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,what a hotel wow so clean so comfy good water pressure good smell sure little on the older side but real good hotel i liked it a lot was here because of an airline missed flight
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,Absolutely gorgeous place! Great service! Was in NY for a concert and this was a last minute grab because we decided to stay an extra night but the hotel meet all our expectations and was honestly better then our original hotel.!

Adria Hotel & Conference Center,4.0,"Rooms are a bit dated, but the location is unbeatable! Amazing value with free on-site parking, a large free breakfast, and super friendly, helpful staff. Clean, comfortable, and perfect for budget travelers who want convenience over modern decor. Highly recommend!"
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"Great location and service.  We needed to interact with the front desk multiple times (delayed flight, broken AC, etc) and they exceeded our expectations each time. Hotel was very easy to get to from the airport and great food options nearby (a duck pond right down the street to get a morning walk in too). Will definitely be back. Andre was great!"
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"This was such an amazing place to stay.  The star was definitely Eddie!! He was so friendly and welcoming. They communicate via text, which is so smart to do!! No worries of calling down to a desk. We were able to send a text when we needed a little extra coffee..  And speaking of coffee, they even have the espresso machine in the front lobby.  Very complete breakfast.  And extremely close to the highway. Was able to do trips in Queens, Brooklyn, and even to Long Island. We will definitely stay here again!"
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,4.0,"Staff is great, stayed for a night to attend a concert.
Nice hotel!"
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,4.0,"Amazing staff, could not say more about them. Rooms are okay but need some upgrades, our toilet broke the second day but they were able to have maintenance fix it while we were out at a concert. They were very pleasant and gracious hosts! Haroon was fabulous!"
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"Nice hotel, with good service and friendly staff. In Queens so little bit further from Manhattan but there are good options of transportation to downtown."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,1.0,"I don‚Äôt usually review businesses on here, but I felt the need this time. I stayed at this hotel for two nights and spent almost $1,000 for the visit. When I arrived, I was told my reservation wasn‚Äôt in the system. No big deal, they gave me an upgrade.

However that night, I discovered that the AC in my room did not work. I woke up to an 80-degree room, and since the bathroom and bed areas were practically the same size, once I showered, it became even warmer. The shutters let all the steam out into the bed area. I reported it that morning to the front desk staff who assured me it would be taken care of. Fast forward to that night, my AC crapped out for the second time, and I found myself waking up sweating again. When I once again told the front desk, he said he didn‚Äôt know where he put the note to maintenance, and was sorry. Honestly, for almost $1,000, that is completely unacceptable, and to think that this room was my upgrade.

On top of this, the breakfast made me sick, the drain in the tub did not stay up, and parking was terrible. The room was clean but that was about it. Terrible experience. Do not recommend."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,4.0,Great experience with the staff - especially Haroon!
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"I found this on a travel site at the last minute. It goes back to a blast from the past from childhood, but with some upgrades. The hotel is clean, as well as the room. Good size TV and even thou the air conditioner is the old school system, it pumps out great air! It‚Äôs not your upscale places, but a diamond in the rough for above basic needs. The staff is excellent and breakfast was decent."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"We booked this hotel to go to the Governor‚Äôs Ball music festival. It‚Äôs a 20 minute drive from the festival in a safe, family-friendly neighborhood. The rooms were clean and it had a free continental breakfast. I want to highlight that the staff is very friendly and accommodating. My daughter left her water bottle behind and they found it and offered to ship it for us. Great customer service and Jessica at the front desk was so helpful."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,4.0,"Super convenient, rooms are small but nicely appointed. Updates in the works. Great value."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"I wanted to extend my deepest gratitude for the exceptional service and hospitality you provided during our stay. Your dedication to ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable experience did not go unnoticed. From the warm greetings at the front desk to the meticulous care from housekeeping, every interaction was marked by professionalism and kindness.

Special thanks to Andre, Jessica, Eddie, Haroon, Maria, Loris, Jose and Yolanda for going above and beyond to make our stay memorable.  Your efforts truly made a difference and made our stay delightful experience.

Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"The attendant on site was Jessica. She is a doll. She is very professional, courteous, understanding and does her job well. We had an issue with our room and she addressed it swiftly with care and concern.
I find her to be an asset to the company and a gem of a person. Please recognize her for her outstanding services."
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,2.0,This property was a huge disappointment given the online ratings and the cost. The room was the biggest problem. The AC unit had a mind of its own. It would not always respond to the thermostat. Turning the shower on and off took wayire effort than it should have even after maintenance worked on it. The room is only servived every 3rd day which was not stated in the online description. The location for my family was favorable but otherwise it was not well situated. The window for the complimentary breakfast was too short and seating was awkward. There was one elevator which was slow.  I will give credit to the staff who were nice  and friendly. The whole facility needed a good face lift
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,4.0,Friendly and very helpful staff.
Adria Hotel & Conference Center,5.0,"My first time coming to New York and I decided to stay at Adria Hotel. I must  say I was very satisfied with, the service even from the breakfast Department  it was nice and clean and a different roster of food would come everyday especially a staff member by the name of ‚ÄúYolanda‚Äù the breakfast attendant she is a sweet heart she made sure that I was ok."

The staff was friendly, helpful, and always ready to assist. I appreciated the complimentary hot breakfast‚Äîgood variety and fresh options. Location is convenient, just a short walk to Coney Island and the subway. Parking on site was a big plus, though spaces are limited. The area is more industrial, but I felt safe, especially with the nearby police station. Overall, a great value for the price, and I would definitely stay here again when visiting Brooklyn."

Best Western Brooklyn-Coney Island Inn,2.0,We called in advance and informed them we wouldn‚Äôt be checking in until 2am once we arrived the parking lot was full the electric car owner parked their car in a spot next to the charger rather than in front of it so be aware someone could do that.. we parked on the street directly in front of the hotel which is on a dead end street that is very quiet nothing but auto shops cement factory and ambulance service. However the staff did not inform us after we told them we parked on the street that our car needed to be moved in the morning due to parking regulations. I received a $60 parking ticket as did a few other guests.. the no parking sign is there but is covered by a tree limb.. the hotel itself was quiet our room had a large bed with extremely small pillows the combination of that and the ac fan not being able to be kept on continuously made it difficult to sleep after a long day of driving.. it‚Äôs a safe hotel and area just be smart when parking and bring an extra pillow
Best Western Brooklyn-Coney Island Inn,5.0,"I stayed here for 4 nights, from Thursday to Monday. The rooms were clean, the breakfast was very tasty, the location is close to the beach. The employees were smiling and friendly. The breakfast woman who fill the tray was working very hard to satisfy everyone, my family appreciates her. Overall it was great stay, I would stay there again."
Best Western Brooklyn-Coney Island Inn,1.0,"I would like to raise a concern about a disturbance that occurred this morning around 6:30 AM.

A staff member was operating or handling the large ice machine near my room at that time, creating extremely loud noise ‚Äì including clattering and mechanical sounds. This was loud enough to wake me up and made it impossible to continue sleeping.

Since many guests are still asleep at this hour, especially those on vacation, such activity is ‚Äì quite frankly ‚Äì a no-go. I approached the staff member and politely asked him to reduce the noise, but unfortunately he showed no understanding or willingness to change his behavior.

I kindly request that this issue be addressed and that staff be instructed to avoid noisy activities like this early in the morning. I would also appreciate the possibility of moving to a quieter room if available.

Thank you for your understanding."

Best Western Brooklyn-Coney Island Inn,1.0,The front desk treats different members very differently and unfairly. Checked in early and we were charged 75 dollars. After checking out this morning we were waiting for a ride and overheard someone else being given a free early check in at the exact same time as us yesterday. Not to mention that we are platinum members and already paid a high price for just one night in a room with stains all over. All would‚Äôve been fine if they didn‚Äôt seemingly try to swindle two girls out of 75 dollars.
Best Western Brooklyn-Coney Island Inn,1.0,"You get what you pay for.
And here you won‚Äôt get much

Price advertised doesn‚Äôt match the price when you get there.
Rude front desk trying to hustle you on the spot by ‚Äúselling the last room‚Äù,

Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,4.0,The Fairfield Inn located in close proximity to the venue we were attending for a wedding. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The bed was a dream. I'm the morning we experienced a delicious breakfast. Check in and check out was seamless. All in all a very nice visit.
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,5.0,"Very clean, good breakfast."
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,2.0,Had to wait 5-10 minutes for hot water for shower. The place is not clean.  We had a room next to a self storage place. The hotel needs improvement. At least the staff is friendly.
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,2.0,"Their service has gone downhill since they first opened. Housekeeping is atrocious. Either they don't come or they do a half-job. The breakfast is disgusting. You save a toll by being on the island, but they're near nothing. Located in the swamps of Staten Island, you may as well stay in Jersey, believe me. And whatever cleaning solution they use, the scent is too strong!"
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,5.0,"Staff on all shifts were so helpful from suggesting transportation routes, options etc to exchanging a remote at midnight.   Room was clean and comfy, coffee was good, i would definitely stay again."

Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,5.0,Good enough
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,4.0,The staff is amazing and room is comfortable.  Only issue I have is the location makes it hard to get to.

Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,1.0,"Booked a reservation and tried to call them for 30 minutes to confirm. Ended up ubering there for them to say reservation online doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs guarantee. Workers are rude and were not helpful

AVOID this hotel unless it‚Äôs your last resort as there‚Äôs better option around and location is not amazing as a tourist."
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,2.0,"Employees great. Room 102 awful . We had no phone, no wifi a non working tv room next to ours had. Some. Similar problems.  Other. Guests told me their rooms were okay"
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,5.0,"The rooms could stand to be a little more soundproof, but that's just a hotel experience in general. The rooms are cozy and clean with a ton of charging outlets. The breakfast bar is a hotel breakfast bar. I don't expect it to be a five-star restaurant, but Nora is it gas station quality."
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,3.0,"At first impression we were not impressed.  It sits adjacent to so abandoned buildings.  There is garbage in the parking lot and weeds growing up all over the place.  There was a homeless encampment across the street.  We got there early and just wanted to ensure our reservation and one male staff behind the desk was very rude. We came back later that evening and had no problem checking in, staff was pleasant.  The hotel was clean and noticed no funky smells.  Our room was clean and had no complaints with it at all. Breakfast it the morning was all your typical stuff.  The eggs and bacon were lukewarm at best.  Overall our stay was fine and the price was reasonable."
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,1.0,I have stayed in Fairfield hotels in the past and have always been pleased. This time was a clear exception. The hallways and our room smelled pungent with marijuana. Staff was uncaring of any needs and not at all friendly. Hotel is in same parking lot as two seemingly closed hotels. I would say you pay for what you get but that did not hold true. It was a pure budget hotel with the Marriott name on the sign.
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,2.0,Very sketchy location with even sketchier people in the area
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,4.0,"Only problem I had that I‚Äôve never had before was that the front desk required Me in order to receive extra towels, I had to bring down My used towels to exchange them. I indicated in the reservation that I would like to have extra towels & extra pillows due to I was given the option to request this. However, after the kind lady at the front desk took about 10 minutes to search for My request for extra towels, She gave Me one set of extra towels for Me & My guest. I‚Äôve never experienced this before.

Other than that, My stay was excellent."
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,1.0,"On Thursday, 6.12.2025 at around Midnight there was an altercation between a female and a male partner outside of room 208. The male parter was being accused of cheating on the enraged female. My wife and I were staying in room 205 with early morning plans starting at 5am. The altercation started at Midnight and concluded at 3:30 am with police needing to arrive in site. When calling the Front Desk, Leasia, stated ‚Äúwe are aware, the police are on the way‚Äù and hung up. Would have been proper to express ‚Äúso sorry for this experience‚Äù and have a Hotel Manager follow up with us immediately the next morning. However it was not addressed by the staff and the guest‚Äôs are expected to make the call to the manager. Terrible experience. Additionally at 11:30pm on Sunday night there were teenagers playing in the hallway. One teenager pulled the fire alarm, waking me up out of fear. Around 1am, teenagers were still playing in the hallway, this time ‚Äúdoor knocking and ditching‚Äù random rooms"

Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,5.0,"I'm not sure where all these bad reviews are coming from regarding this hotel. There were a few things here and there such as the juice machine was giving them trouble but they were trying. Breakfast was great, the room was spotless, super hot water, staff friendly, and any minor issue was addressed quickly.  Yes the neighborhood was a little sketchy but it was super easy to get to off the expressway which on Staten Island is amazing. Can't comment on price as my partner had points.   Would stay again!"
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,5.0,Outstanding staff stay here many times the breakfast buffet speaks for itself
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,4.0,"Only 10 minutes from the Staten Island mall. The hotel has plenty of parking! The rooms are very clean. The walls are thin, but that‚Äôs typical for most NYC buildings. We heard people sneezing from the next room. Otherwise, I would stay at this location again."
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,2.0,"Very loud and noisy. Lot of people living in the hotel. Even a school bus to pick up kids there They have a bar but it's closed. Breakfast was poor. Stale cereal, eggs and waffles were not very hot. No remote for the TV hair dryer also did not work in the room"
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,5.0,Really nice and clean and comfy
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,3.0,The gentleman at the front desk was quite friendly and helpful. My room was a good size and clean.
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,5.0,The only real downfall of the hotel location if one is doing ride share or taxis to get around is there in not any restaurants in close proximity.
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,1.0,"I was in Staten Island for this bullshit. They got my room wrong, so I had to get it corrected. When I got to the corrected room, the air didn't work. The maintenance man fixed it, but the heat didn't work. The room was so cold. The rooms were incorrect, and the corrected room smelled horrible. The carpet felt moist."

Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,1.0,"Worst Hotel Experience! We booked 1 room with 2 Queens, and upon arrival late at night after we're done our tour, we knew then that without prior notice of any kind they've decided instead to place us in 2 separate Rooms with one Queen each; when we have 2 kids. How would we split?!
Then, next day we came at the end of the day to have them telling us you need to take your stuff from one of the rooms, you've  been checked out by a hotel staff member; again without prior notice or call or text. And our stuff was all inside still! Save yourself the hassle & find a better place!"

Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,Great curry chicken and hot sauce. Always coming back for those
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,I feel this neighborhood has been lacking a West Indian Chinese restaurant. Food is absolutely delicious. Love the tamarin balls. They are my fave. I tried the chicken fried rice. Chicken was juicy fried well nice and crispy. The rice was yummy. Had a lot of different ingredients I enjoyed the variety.
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,"I seen other reviews online and decided to give this place a try. The food is delicious. Definitely look forward to returning and trying other items on their menu.

Chicken fried riced was delicious. The rice wasn‚Äôt over cooked, very flavorful, and the chicken was cooked to perfection very juicy and savory."
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,3.0,Bought the curry chicken today 7/2 . Very salty and with a bitter aftertaste . Not what‚Äôs expected . Maybe only limited to this batch but when you are paying you want to enjoy your meal .  Still a very clean and nice restaurant. Good luck .
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,This is my favorite Guyanese Restaurant!! The food is amazing and so delicious!
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,"Did both goat and lamb there and will get back for more. Haven't tried their Chinese yet, but it's on my list. I've heard good things about it."
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,Customer service was outstanding and the food was amazing this was my first time there and I enjoyed the food.
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,"As a foodie who's travel all over the country, I must say this restaurant is very underrated and I'm surprised it has not gone viral yet. I don't like coming to places more than once unless the food is really delicious but this spot is worth coming back too. Everything on the menu is flavorful, fresh and made with love. The kind lady who was running the register was also very kind and generous. She had introduced to many new deserts and appetizers that were made fresh from kitchen, that my taste buds had never experienced before. If you like West Indian and Chinese food freshly made, then this place is a must go to!"
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,Visiting from Atlanta and came across Sabo on Google. The reviews looped me in so I decided to visit.

Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,"I had an amazing experience at Sabo West Indian & Chinese Restaurant! Everything was fresh, well-seasoned, and made with care.

Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,Very tasty üòã
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,4.0,"Did a take out order. Roast pork, pepper shrimp from appetizer menu. Chicken fried rice and mixed chow mein. Eggs balls for next mornings breakfast! Everything was really good except the pepper shrimp was full of bell peppers and onions very tiny shrimp compared to other establishments similar. Also seems like more of a main dish than appetizer it was saut√©ed in a sauce that was very greasy and definitely not spicy as advertised. However I‚Äôd suggest they do a fried or grilled shrimp jumbo tossed with some sliced hot peppers and scallions no sauce. Otherwise I‚Äôd definitely order everything else again. For egg ball reheating I did 365 degrees 15 mins in air fryer. It came out brand new! Give this place a try!!!"
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,Good fresh food and very nice people !!!
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,"First time going, food was really amazing and the service was top notch.  Truly looking forward to returning for more"
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,Omg this restaurant i would highly recommend.The food is 10 out of 10.I just tried the roti omg so delicious with curry duck..I enjoy this food from this restaurant.They will always have me as a customer.
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,I bought fried rice from this restaurant twice and it was so delicious‚Ä¶the best I had for a long time. Highly recommend
Sabo West Indian and Chinese Restaraunt,5.0,"I was referred to this spot by a friend, and I‚Äôm so glad I gave it a try! This was my first time tasting Guyanese Chinese cuisine, and it definitely did not disappoint.

Chicken Fried Rice ‚Äì 5/5! The standout for me was how they fried the chicken separately and then added it to the fried rice. It felt fresher and crispier compared to the usual one-pot fried rice. Absolutely loved it.

Shrimp Chow Mein ‚Äì The flavor here was unique, unlike anything I‚Äôve had before. It had a richness that really grew on me the more I ate it. Very delicious and satisfying.

But the real star of the meal was the Dhal with Roti. I‚Äôve never had it quite like this before, and it was easily my favorite dish of the night. The dhal was perfectly spiced, and the roti was so soft and fresh. Highly recommend!

I‚Äôll definitely be back to explore more of their menu!"

I felt compelled to call the restaurant and let them know that the Chef actually made my night! I grew up in a small town in Massachusetts that is famous for its authentic Portuguese food and living in New York now I haven‚Äôt really been able to find a reliable Portuguese restaurant. I‚Äôve been craving the perfect steak for so long and this place delivered! Not to mention, the portion was insane and I‚Äôll have enough to enjoy it for lunch tomorrow too.

Bar is a great sports bar with multiple screens that will show all the games, only thing I have not seen is hockey.

Edit: seen hockey."

I had other foods from there also good...The past two times I have been, the servers were horrible in which I think is why we waited so long for our food however, the food is good...good location.. good street parking on side blocks.  Overall, good little spot. But they need better servers. The MANAGER or owner ..not sure who he is ..is always friendly and welcoming."

Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"Loved the atmosphere. We ate outside on the patio. It was 13 of us  on a Sunday  after church. They were limd enough  to let's us have it to ourselves.

I love supporting local business and sometimes you‚Äôre disappointed but sometimes you get a pleasant surprise like this one. The food was great, the atmosphere (at least inside) was cozy and upscale. But chile‚Ä¶.. The whiting, Mac and cheese, and green beans were all on point. Seasoned to the capital T and not too salty. Ordered vanilla pudding cake to go and got the hugest slice!! Checked out upstairs and in the back for a possible party in the future. Will be back for sure!"

Nettie's Restaurant,3.0,"I would have loved to actually experience dining here however I was mislead by staff. I called ahead just to ensure that they would be open for brunch and inquired about the time it was set to end. I was told brunch service stops at 5:30pm, however when I arrived I was met with the surprise and disappointment that the establishment was in the process of shutting down service. I arrived around 4:30, I initially called around 3:30pm. I would do have wasted my time getting ready and coming to the restaurant if I was aware they were found to close. In the future I hope you guys can have better communications with potential customers."
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,Nice quiet place to eat and have drinks loved it
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"I had an absolutely delightful experience at this gem of a restaurant! The food was incredible‚Äîfull of lovely flavors that evoked the warmth and comfort of home cooking. What truly elevated the meal, though, was the wonderful conversation I had with the owner. There‚Äôs something so special about sharing stories over delicious food!

The ambiance of the place is stunning, with a setup that's both inviting and aesthetically pleasing. I also love that it‚Äôs a black-owned establishment; the positive energy is truly infectious! It was a bustling Saturday brunch when we visited, and although there was a bit of a wait, let me tell you, it was so worth it!

Our waitress was great ‚Äîopen about the menu and eager to make recommendations. Her kindness and hospitality really stood out, and another waitress pitched in to ensure we had everything we needed. You can really feel that this spot is cherished in the community, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience!"
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,This place was really nice. My friends and I stopped by on Saturday after work and the food was amazing and the restaurant aura was very welcoming including the staff. The owner introduced himself and sat and chatted with us. Def will be coming again.
Nettie's Restaurant,4.0,"Just returned from a trip to this restaurant.  In honor of Juneteenth we wanted to celebrate with a real southern cooked meal that didnt come from our own kitchen.
We arrived a few minutes after 8 pm and our order was taken within a minute of us arriving.
We were greeted by a friendly young woman.  We ordered two simple dishes, one fried chicken, and one fried catfish, and one slice of banana pudding cake.
Each  meal came with two sides, and the cornbread is extra.
We then proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait.
While we were waiting we had time to enjoy the ambiance, which was charming.
It was late, so there were not many patrons in the dining room, but those that were seemed to be enjoying themselves.
The environment was clean, however after that initial interaction with the hostess, no one came to check on us or give us an update. We were the only ones in the waiting area, with the exception of the dining room patrons who were coming and going.
It wasnt until 8:50 that the owner came out and asked what we were waiting for. At this point we had endured a 45 minute wait to two plates that would have been prepared at Rib Shack on linden blvd in less than 15.
When we explained that we had been waiting the better part of an hour he hurriedly went back to the kitchen. Within 5-7 minutes he came back with our food and a promise that we would enjoy it.
He explained that his workers were from the community and they were trying to put things out faster. He made no gestures such as a complimentary desert or piece of cornbread  as compensation for a near hour long wait for two entrees and a desert, and we didn't suggest it.
Both dishes, four pieces of cornbread and one piece of cake cost $81.00.
We left with our meals, and hoped it was worth the wait.
The catfish meal came with green beans and potato salad.
The fish was fried perfectly and was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.
This signaled that the fish had not been put in the fryer until the owner came out to question us.
The green beans were well seasoned and the potato salad was decent.
3.8/5
My partner had the fried chicken with mac and collard greens.
His was overcooked.  The leg and thigh had been left too long in the oil.  The mac and cheese was enjoyable, but the collard greens were ‚Äúgritty‚Äù.
The cornbread was good, but it was box made.
3/5 for his meal.
The banana pudding cake 4.2/5

Overall i would try this resturant again, however i have noticed a trend when it comes to ‚Äúour restaurants‚Äù,  either the food is fast and mid, or good but slow.
This is a case of the latter. The food was good, but waiting 49 minutes for two dishes in a not crowded restaurant is an L."
Nettie's Restaurant,4.0,"The night started off a little rough, but it ended on a good note.  The waiting time was too long, but the overall atmosphere is great.  The owner is very nice and personable.  He gave my husband a free beer and shot for Father's Day, which was  nice. The food was good. I had the turkey wings, greens and rice and peas. It was well seasoned."

Nettie's Restaurant,4.0,"The food was delicious. Mac and cheese and shrimp were good, although 5 fried shrimp did seem a bit skimp, compared to the 2 large turkey wings my mom got üòÖ

I will say the service could have been better, our waiter was not attentive at all likely due to the fact they were so busy and definitely seemed understaffed. We waited at least 10-15 minutes before they even asked us for drinks and got our orders started.

Overall, nice vibe. Definitely would head back when it‚Äôs not so busy."
Nettie's Restaurant,4.0,"Great atmosphere, the owner came and introduced himself. The staff was great and the food tasted good. I ordered French Toast and wanted some of that unhealthy pork bacon which was not an option."

Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,my Grand daughter Love it i took her there and she said it was the best day ever . she rated a 10
Nettie's Restaurant,4.0,The food is decent.  Priced reasonably.  Only thing I didn't like was the chicken cut across the bone that leaves small fragments. It's hell on my teeth.  I can't comment on the atmosphere as I did takeout
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,A girl's trip to this soul food restaurant was Everything.
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"Discovered this hidden gem from a FB group. Decided to try and was glad I did. Ordered salmon string beans and collarded greens. The salmon was a good portion with a tasty BarBQ sauce, collareds were well cooked and the string beans were lightly seasoned with just enough crunch.
The decor is old world mixed with new events motifs. Clean and smelled good.
Met the owner and was instantly welcomed and I felt like he was a neighbor I hadnt seen since last winter. Very welcoming, and took the time to show me around.
I will be back and with friends."
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"Nice place. Small, but comfortable. Nice vibe, nice music playing softly in the background. I had the turkey wings, mac n cheese, and collard greens, and they were absolutely delicious. Danny, the owner, is very personable. Would absolutely go back for more!"
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"The service was great, the food was excellent! I had the barbecue salmon. Not overdone, cooked to perfection. The collard greens were just that, not a bowl of stems, and well seasoned. The macaroni and cheese was well flavored and cheesy!"
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"Great spot! Blackowned. Food was excellent. I wish they opened earlier. Owner came up to the table and spoke to us as if we were family. Great service! Catfish and fried chicken was so juicy! There was a random Taurus celebration.  One Taurus customer pulled an elder Taurus customer in to celebrate on live. I love us! They played Stevie version of happy birthday ""of course"". The general music was a nice soft Jazz. Pretty busy for 12pm brunch. Plenty of T.V.'s to watch whatever. They were on mute. Real nice spot."
Nettie's Restaurant,4.0,"Good is incredible soul food. I had the catfish platter which was flaky and tender.
The only negative was the service time. It took over 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered. It didn't really feel busy enough to warrant that wait time."
Nettie's Restaurant,1.0,This was great experience for me and the whole family.
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"The food was delicious. The  customer service was great as well. The owner even came to our table and sat down and had a conversation with us, 10 out of 10. I will be revising the restaurant again."
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"This is my new favorite place. I absolutely love love the food in this place.  When I walked through the front door I was greeted by a lovely young lady and great R&B music soothing to my ears. The  Atmosphere gave me an old school vibe with televisions on all the walls if you choose to watch. The music was all I needed as I rocked in my seat looking over the menu. This is a reasonable price dinning venue. I had the catfish, mac n cheese, with collard greens. The fish was sooooo Juicy and flaky. The mac n cheese and collard greens was just as wonderful. This is a must visit place and I will Definitely visit this place over and over again so if you read my comments and visit this place please let the Owners know that Teelove sent you!!!"
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"Go because you want to have an upscale food service experience that happens to be black owned, with black excellence instilled into all of the service staff. The decor is nostalgic mixed with rustic chic and modern elements. But the ""southern hospitality"" has northern sense & sensibilities mixed in. The menu covers all the basics so that everyone will find something they want. The servers were very accommodating, available, and on top of our requests. The owner, Dan, is a very present source for the great energy in the room. He made sure everyone was satisfied and satiated. Excellent for large groups, small gatherings, and just sitting at the bar. My only suggestion... let me know when you get some apple cobbler or pie on the menu. Loved it and will be back to try more offerings. #LocalGem #GoodEats #theresthatfoodie"
Nettie's Restaurant,2.0,"The food is delicious, but you don‚Äôt get your monies worth. 28.00 for 2 pieces of whitings, collard greens, and yams. That‚Äôs a lot."
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"In one word, Delicious!"
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"My three kids, husband and I went to Nettie‚Äôs on Easter Sunday and yes it was extremely busy and felt like forever just to get seated however from a almost terrible experience the manager came got us and treated us like family! Having three hungry kids ain‚Äôt no joke lol however the FOOD was AMAZING AMAZING!!! 10 out of 10 we ordered the Chicken and Waffles (perfection), catfish and grits, and burger was amazing for the kids! The atmosphere and the people made you felt right at home! Will definitely be back and the manager even took a family picture of us and gave my three kids 7,4 and 1 yr old Easter baskets which they love! Thank you for the amazing experience and thank you for turning an almost horrible experience to an amazing one for my family!"
Nettie's Restaurant,3.0,"My close friend and I went here after brunch for the dinner menu. They were still trying to recover from the brunch service, which is okay. The food was pretty bad. I had to send the Mac and cheese back because there was no salt in the water when they made the noodles. After it came back, it had a little salt, but it was tasteless. The drinks were okay as well, but overall, I'll try again during brunch and hope for better"

Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,Great food and service. A neighborhood gem.
Nettie's Restaurant,1.0,"I came here with a friend before attending a concert and unfortunately our experience sucked! We saw there was a wait, so we asked if could sit at the bar. There were 2 open seats so I thought it would be fine. However, after 15 min we were still waiting for water and no one offered to take our order. When we finally got drinks, we asked to put our food orders in since we were keeping track of time. Our orders were taken by a man who worked there. Overall, it seemed the staff was way too relaxed to be bothered with customers. He obviously had no idea what he was doing and we didn't get our food. After 20 more min, we asked about our orders and instead of being honest, he made up an excuse effectively blaming the kitchen for ""overcooking"" our lamb. We knew this was bs. Then he had the audacity to get an attitude when we said we didn't want the food anymore. We didn't have time to eat it that point. I don't know who this man thinks he is but he seemed like a manager? At that point it didn't matter, we just wanted to leave. I'll never go back to this place. It's unfortunate I didn't get to try the food but the customer service was horrendous. It was so bad I didn't even want the food at that point! I hope they get better but I won't be back!"
Nettie's Restaurant,5.0,"Hello üëãüèΩ my wife and I decided to drive up to the city for some soulfood via Allentown pa, and we went to Queens to give Nettie's a try minus the traffic ü§¨ the GPS took the forever route needles to say we made it just in time b4 closing. After ordering waiting in the seating area the owner Danny came out and greeted us then arranged for us to enjoy our meals b4 getting back on the road Danny sat with us as we enjoyed our dinner the brothers Hospitality was top tier and very welcoming, the food was on point ""you better say it!""

Casa Margaritas Restaurant & Bar,3.0,"The pina colada, shrimp and calamari appetizer, and tres leche were great. The fajitas mixtas was decent."
Casa Margaritas Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"I have been going to Casa margaritas for about 4 years now and I truly love it. I moved to Elmont from Suffolk and I needed a good local spot for drinks and food. I was tired of the generic franchises that I have been going to Since my early twenties they are overrated and all are due for renovations and a menu upgrade (Fridays, Applebees ect.) So the hunt was on for a good local spot. I found casa margaritas on google. My first day I went with my friend Jen (who also loves casa margaritas) we had drinks some food and actually left and went to Gordos down the block to try it out. We ended up leaving Gordos after 1 drink and went back to casa margaritas. The food is BOMB üí£ my favorite dishes are the bandeja tipica which is the National dish of Colombia and the fish filet with shrimp that comes in a delicious creamy sauce. The drinks are BOMB üí£ my favorite margarita is the Spicy Tamarindo with Tajin on the rim on the rocks. The vibes are high the service is spectacular. The team is very attentive from the moment you enter the establishment until you leave. Food is fresh, hot and comes out pretty fast in my opinion. The prices are very reasonable for the high quality, great tasting food and portions you are receiving. If you come across Casa Margaritas I encourage you to go you wont regret itüòÅ birthdays are also very nice. I haven‚Äôt had one there yet but I‚Äôve seen sooo many there and its awesome ü•≥. Im deff doing a birthday üéà dinner at Casa Margaritas this year. I‚Äôve also brought just about every friend here and they LOVE Casa Margaritas as well. Im a regular I go at least 1-2 times a week sometimes even
3-4 times a week in the summers. They also have a great variety and diverse playlist. I‚Äôve had many drinks many dishes all are spectacular ü§© Keep up the Great Job guys üëè"

Casa Margaritas Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"This spot was bangggging. My friend and I stopped by during the heatwave last week and it was perfect. It was nice and cold inside, the music wasn‚Äôt too loud, and the frozen margaritas were doing what they had to do. We visited during happy hour and the margaritas were pleasantly strong! We each ordered one entree and we both had leftovers. Super yummy and we‚Äôre looking forward to returning!"
Casa Margaritas Restaurant & Bar,5.0,This the first time that I‚Äôve been to this restaurant.  The food was delicious and the Pina Colota was the best that I‚Äôve ever tasted!  This restaurant was recommended to me for a small party of 10 in July..  I can‚Äôt wait!  Delicious!!!!!

Casa Margaritas Restaurant & Bar,5.0,"Drinks were amazing, atmosphere was awesome and food was so good and the bill for 4 people wasn't even 200.00! 8.00 Happy hour drinks!

Casa Margaritas Restaurant & Bar,1.0,"I‚Äôve been to this restaurant about five times in the past two weeks‚Äîyour tacos are amazing, and I keep coming back for them. However, I recently tried the fried snapper and was really disappointed. It was completely burnt and overly greasy. I tried calling the restaurant multiple times to speak with someone, but couldn‚Äôt get through. Unfortunately, I ended up throwing the whole fish away. I genuinely enjoy your food and hope this was just a one-off mistake, but the lack of response made the experience even more frustrating."

JFK INN- Hotel JFK Airport New York,1.0,Goodbye Playboy Mansion Goodbye Jüíã
JFK INN- Hotel JFK Airport New York,1.0,JFK Inn parking was trash will never do this shit again. You get what you pay for though. The man doesn‚Äôt know how to do business and was so money hungry that he had cars parking in spots blocking me in for 20 mins before he was able to move it. Was not responsive on the phone until after the  10th time calling him. After a long flight and waiting to get back home this is not good for business. I do not recommend and will NEVER use it again .

JFK INN- Hotel JFK Airport New York,5.0,"This place was so Wonderhoy! My husband took me for our honey moon, sure the walls were thin but it worked. There were cockroaches in my room, and mold on the walls. But I love cockroaches as they‚Äôre my favorite insects! The breakfast here was a bit expired as the bread was moldy and the milk was sour. But my 10 kids like it like that. My husband was so happy, he also had poop on toilet. Will be coming back."
JFK INN- Hotel JFK Airport New York,1.0,"I went on vacation  on May 16 2025. They used  a cargo van to drop me off at federal Circle not The terminal. The van was disguising and terrified. When I came back I called them to pick me up they never showed up. While I‚Äôm checking my car, my car was scratched and no body there to talk to. The place look like a getho and it looks like there was illegal activities going on. This place is terrible do not park your vehicle there because u will park at ur own risk. I filed a law suit against them to repair my car."
Best Western Jamaica Inn,5.0,Close to JFK had a great stay. Was accommodating with a 6am check in as the room was leftover from the day before and already clean. We checked out at 8pm same day.

Best Western Jamaica Inn,2.0,"Ein Hotelzimmer f√ºr 4 N√§chte im Stockwerk ""C"", dem Kellergeschoss!!! Eine Erfahrung der anderen Art. Fensterblick in einen Lichtschacht. Nach oben konnte man durch ein Gitterrost an der Sto√üstange eines parkenden Autos vorbei nur eine Handbreit Himmel erkennen. Erl√§uterungen zum Alarm bei √úberschreitung des Kohlenmonoxid - Grenzwertes lagen auf dem Tisch.
OK, Zimmer war sauber, Fr√ºhst√ºck f√ºr US - Verh√§ltnisse OK, es gab sogar Schinkenspeck und R√ºhrei, auch Obst.
N√§he zum JFK Airport sowie zur Metrostation Briarwood sind auch g√ºnstig. Aber das wiegt den Lichtschachtausblick nicht auf!"
Best Western Jamaica Inn,3.0,This hotel is okay. The only issue I had was with the noise. You can hear when someone open and closes their entry door. You can hear the talking in the hallway. Disturbance runs late into the night and starts early in the morning. You can hear everything outside as if there were no walls. I was definitely not well rested staying at this hotel.
Best Western Jamaica Inn,5.0,It's a very clean hotel. I enjoyed my stay!
Best Western Jamaica Inn,5.0,The friendliness of the staff and the morning breakfast as well as the convenience make this an awesome hotel.  It is a little rundown

Guy at the Night Shift reception; we called him several times about the issue. Even the technician came in and confirmed that their air conditioning is not working.But the night shift guy denied the return, so we can try another hotel to sleep as we are unable to sleep; the air conditioning is not working at all. We are struggling to breathe."

Best Western Jamaica Inn,3.0,"The room was quite expensive at $204 (around $180 with membership), which still felt overpriced. While spacious, it lacked proper lighting‚Äîonly a desk lamp, nightstand lamp, and entry light, leaving the room dim. The building is clearly old. The vending machine near the lobby doesn‚Äôt take cards or bills‚Äîonly quarters, which is inconvenient.

On the positive side, the room was clean, and the housekeeping staff and receptionists were friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was decent, though sandwiches would have been a nice addition."
Best Western Jamaica Inn,1.0,"This is a very bad hotel and the pictures are misleading. DO NOT BOOK!

I got my flight delayed and had to stay nearby JFK for my morning flight. I usually go with BW hotels but this was not even close. I got the room at the lower level, the sheets seemed not clean, and the cold was coming through the window even though it was fully shut.

Walked out 3 min after, complained to the staff and I called Booking.com for a refund. The manager said yes, but then every time we called him for verbal confirmation he pretended to be in a meeting, we called multiple times and gave up. I figured the manager is lying to us. He never reached out."
Best Western Jamaica Inn,1.0,"Absolutely Dreadful Stay - Avoid at All Costs!
My recent stay was nothing short of a nightmare. I was relegated to what felt like a sub-basement dungeon with absolutely no view to speak of. The hallway noise was relentless, making it impossible to get any peace. To top it off, the provided hairdryer was disgustingly clogged with someone else's hair ‚Äì a clear indication of poor hygiene. And as if that wasn't enough, loud yelling outside persisted, further disrupting any chance of relaxation. Save yourself the misery and book elsewhere!"

Best Western Jamaica Inn,5.0,nice place
Best Western Jamaica Inn,3.0,"Close to the HWY and the airport. However, the rooms are outdated, and the service was ok. The Asian guy who works midshift was great.

The room wasn't cleaned after the desk told me it would be. They didn't take the trash out.

Our room smelt like weed because someone was smoking right outside our window. I believe the parking lot needs to be more supervised to prevent that from happening to other tenants."
Best Western Jamaica Inn,5.0,"The first time I went there, the room had a leak in the ceiling (Room C8). It didn't affect me since it was in the corner but we also didnt have any shampoo or body wash, had to go to the front desk to get a few soaps and small shampoo/conditioner bottles. This is my 2nd time. Again we didn't have shampoo and bodywash but we just went to the front desk. Minor matters though. I know the housekeepers work very hard and people forget or make mistakes. I don't request services everyday but when they do come, the room is left really clean and extra towels, floor mats and face towels are always provided. The breakfast option is pretty simple but good. Never used the gym but there is one and it's usually empty when I go looking since it's located right next to the breakfast room. The staff are extremely polite and accommodating. I love the location of this inn. Close to the train station. Very convenient! Overall a good option to stay at."

Best Western Jamaica Inn,4.0,"I'm a New Yorker born and bred, so when I tell you New York has changed boy I'm not kidding! This is the first time I had to pay to stay at a hotel. Surprisingly with the city bring over crowded we had a difficult time locating a room ourselves.  So we got a booking agent. She got a nice room at Best Western on Van Wyck. Room was clean and nice. Especially the bathroom. The receptionist was knowledgeable and pleasant. My only negative experience was the breakfast. It was unappealing and their wasn't good choices. Being this hotel is consider to be choice. I expect more. There was cereal, yogurt. Just Blah! Best Western needs to do a better job.
Update
When I tell you this place made a changes I'm not kidding. Imagine my surprise when I decided to give breakfast at this hotel one more try I was amazed. The food selection was amazingüëè! They hold a choice of juice. Girl! I love juice, they had choices of cereal, pastries, coffee, and fruit. I stayed there for five days. I didn't have to buy a thing after leaving food left me full and healthy. Great job Staff of Best Western! üëå"

The first room we were given a key too upon entry, upon entry, the room looked like somebody was already living there. The bed was unmade and the towels were used. The second room was just OK. I convinced my wife to just go to just close her eyes and  try to get some sleep and when we wake up, we‚Äôll be in the cab, back to the airport and on our way home.

Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,4.0,"The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly. The hotel is located very close to the subway and the airport (very convenient). However, we did notice more graffiti and rubbish in this part of town. Plus, some unusual characters wearing washing basket lids on their heads. Near the subway there was an increased police presence. We opted to arrange for an Uber from the hotel to the airport that evening, rather than taking the subway."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,2.0,"Stayed here with a friend after a last minute cancelled flight. It was easy to book, reasonably priced, and conveniently located for airport commuting.

Room was fine for a one night stay - clean. Weirdly humid, the floor was moist(?).

I did want to alert my fellow female travelers: yes, the area is sketchy, but sometimes it just be like that. HOWEVER at 11pm at night, a homeless man repeatedly knocked on our door. The homeless man had told the front desk attendant that he was staying in our room and strangely, the attendant called us to ask us if he was. We heard the homeless man knocking on doors and singing in the hallways. After several rounds of knocks, the man eventually left, but it's still concerning he was able to make it up to the rooms.

It was uncomfortable as two women and we did not feel safe or that our concerns were taken seriously by the hotel staff."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,3.0,"Good for an overnight stay, rooms where clean and staff was friendly but location to my view is not so great"
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,"I rarely write reviews, but my stay at this Holiday Inn was so disappointing that I felt compelled to warn others. From start to finish, the experience was unacceptable.

Check-in was painfully slow, with an unreasonably long wait despite a short line. When I finally reached the front, the check-in clerk was rude and dismissive, more interested in loudly praising ‚ÄúMother India‚Äù over the US than actually helping me. It was uncomfortable and unprofessional.

The lobby had a foul, lingering curry-like odor that was overpowering and unpleasant. Unfortunately, things only got worse once I got to the room.

The room was dirty and clearly hadn‚Äôt been vacuumed. I found two cockroaches ‚Äî one alive and one dead ‚Äî which was horrifying. The bathroom had a visible dirt ring around the shower, and the linens on the bed were stained. It felt more like a neglected roadside motel than a major hotel chain.

Between the unacceptable cleanliness, poor customer service, and overall condition of the hotel, this was hands-down the worst hotel experience I‚Äôve ever had. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this property to anyone and will be avoiding Holiday Inn in the future if this is the standard they allow."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,"BED BUGS!!!!!! BED BUGS!!!! STAY AWAY!!!

I stayed at this hotel out of necessity when my flight was canceled out of JFK late at night. The staff were helpful and kind, and the room seemed clean and was very comfortable.

However‚Ä¶ I woke up the next day with eight very swollen bedbug bites on the back of my leg. Absolutely disgusting.  I was very discreet when I left the front desk now as I was not trying to make a big deal, there were other people in the lobby. I spoke with the hotel operator, Gary. He gave me his business card and apologized immediately and let me know they would be refunding my stay. I thanked him for handling the issue appropriately.

Fast-forward to over a week later. They did not refund my stay. On top of that, they are screening my calls. I‚Äôve been calling multiple times a day for several days. I‚Äôve been calling every number listed for this property as well as the number is directly from Gary‚Äôs business card.  Again, the hotel is literally screening my calls and will not pick up. I know there‚Äôs nothing wrong with their phone because when I called the hotel the night that I stayed, they picked up immediately with no issue. But 25 phone calls later and it just rings endlessly.

I was not going to make a public deal about this, but since the hotel is not only been unclean, but also now dishonest and shady, I had no choice, but to file a complaint with IHG corporate.

Unfortunately, IHG corporate does not seem to be very helpful. I followed up with them today after initially filing the case two days ago. Thus far the hotel has made the following statement. ‚Äúwhile she enjoyed the room all night long and only had a problem in the morning when she checked out, therefore, we are not refunding her.‚Äù

First of all the hotel was the one that initially offered me the refund. Second of all yes, that‚Äôs how it works when you get bit by bedbugs. You sleep in a bed and you wake up in the morning with bites. I didn‚Äôt even check into the hotel until midnight, went straight to bed and woke up the next morning with bites and immediately brought it to the hotel‚Äôs attention.

Absolutely disgusting and shady hotel I would recommend staying far away"
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,"I have made a reservation to IHG via confirmation number #22153515 for a night stay (29Jul - 30 Jul). When I visited the property and highlighted about my reservation, the front desk official has assigned me a room on a fresh reservation #65344862 (completely ignoring my above reservation).

Now, I have been charged twice to my bank statement, one as a stay and one as no show, which is totally wrong.

On calling multiple times to the front desk, they keep on deferring the resolution.

PS: IHG HELP DESK IS ALSO OF NO HELP, THEY PUSH THIS BACK TO HOTEL.

Very annoying and very pathetic customer service and support."

Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,4.0,"Our flight was cancelled so we were stranded having never been to NYC before. Ended up staying here two nights. The room was very clean, staff we interacted with were very nice. The location is a five minute walk from the Airtrain station. Now, the caution. It is in a very skechy neighborhood..loads of trash, homeless, etc. You can‚Äôt really walk around and explore. Stores and eateries close by did not look approachable to us. As for being convenient to major attractions, it is a one hour subway ride to Manhattan where most of the museums are located. It‚Äôs only $2.90 for the subway, but you will be sitting on it for awhile. It worked for us in a pinch and prices were reasonable (New York city reasonable.)"
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,4.0,"Had to book a room for a canceled flight.  Book here thru the app.  Room was clean, it was a little noisy outside the room as a family was partying on the backside of the hotel.  I went down and Sammy [Sam] said he'd check for another room. Gave me a key and room was great, switched rooms.

Now this area is not a great area to go walking around if you have kids. But the hotel was clean and accommodating.

There is a Chinese restaurant, one block down towards the Jamaica station that has awsome take out if you need food.,"
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,5.0,2nd stay here. Good just like before. Easy access to Airtrain.
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,3.0,Staff is friendly
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,"Absolutely disgusting experience. The room was filthy from the moment I walked in, there were used rags on the floor, leftover food on the table, and the bed had hairs, toenail clippings, and stains. It was clear the room had not been cleaned at all.

When I told the front desk, he barely responded and did nothing to resolve the situation. I felt completely dismissed.

This place is a health hazard and should not be operating like this. Do not stay here unless you‚Äôre okay with sleeping in someone else‚Äôs mess."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,This is probably the Worst holiday inn I‚Äôve ever been too. The service and Up keep is horrible.. the front desk associates are very rude!! The female with blonde hair to be specific. I‚Äôm a gold member so I travel a lot using IHG and this hotel don‚Äôt honor the guest promised experience. And they don‚Äôt even have a well kept snack area everything‚Äôs expired.. I called the previous day to claim my complimentary room upgrade(which was from a king to a double bed). They confirmed the day before and once I got there they didn‚Äôt want to honor it. Now I have to share a small room with 3 ppl when I was confirmed on a double bed. ‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt have any towels in the room when I got in - I then had to wait almost 5hrs before I got some.. this place is just horrible‚Ä¶
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,4.0,"After our first experience with another hotel in this area, we were pleasantly surprised with our stay here. Yes, it is in a sketchy area, but it is a straight shot of a few blocks to the train station, and since we were traveling as a pair, we felt safe enough. Location proximity to the station is great, location safely, ehhhh.

We dealt with several different people at the front desk during our stay. We booked 2 nights (single nights under 2 separate reservations) and they let us combine them and stay in our same room. They were also accommodating regarding a late checkout in recognition of my IHG status. Thank you!!!

Lots of positives about the room. First and foremost, it was clean and new-ish. We felt very comfortable in there. The bed, bedding, pillows, were all fantastic! So cozy. We had a little trouble with the AC (is is controlled at the wall? on the unit?). So, after our first warm-ish night, we were able to get that sorted. We had plenty of space for our luggage, which we lived out of for the two days. Loved the fact that there was a coffee maker w/ pods, a fridge, and a safe (though for some reason, that was not bolted down. Hmm).

And we didn't find the road noise quite as bad this time, but DID hear our next door neighbor's music until around midnight or so. Sleeping with our ear plugs in helped to block it all out.

Overall a GREAT stay. If we are in this area again, this will be my top choice of where to stay for the price point."

Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,2.0,"Close to air train to JFK. Neighborhood is bad. Hotel is noisy. There are way better hotels under this brand. Stayed here waiting for next flight, do not plan to stay again unless must."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,3.0,No parking.
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,"My wife, baby and I booked this hotel due to a cancelled flight on the way back from Europe. We were surprised to wake up to a bed full of ants and forced into an early check out. When we expressed our frustration to the front desk, he offered rewards points. We declined and asked for full or partial reimbursement for the inconvenience. He said he could not do it but the hotel GM would give us a call to help on Monday. After a few days into the week and no call, we started calling but have never heard anything back. Going on two months, we are not expecting to hear from anyone. What a terrible experience and a shame that this one location has left a bad taste in our mouth for Holiday Inn and associated hotels. We will do everything we can to avoid ever staying in another hotel associated with the brand again."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,4.0,"Room was clean, front desk service was great, pillow softness labelling was very helpful. Short walk to the AirTrain and shorty ride to airport. The, board of flight departure times in the lobby and was a nice touch. It‚Äôs true the neighborhood is a bit sketchy but it‚Äôs a 5-minute walk from AirTrain to the hotel door, and it‚Äôs all part of the NYC experience."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,"Not good, bad service"
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,3.0,"I had to stay overnight for a long layover. The main reason why I booked was because it was a reputable brand, affordable and had airport shuttle service.  After waiting for 40 minutes for the shuttle, I called the hotel and was told they no longer offer the shuttle service (24 hour service as advertised). I had to Uber to and from the hotel ($60+ which i would've rather spent on better accommodations with shuttle service). Front desk manager was very ""matter of fact"" when I asked why they advertise shuttle service when there is none. No apology, no concern whatsoever. I had joined IHG rewards as part of the booking but I have zero intentions on ever booking anything Holiday Inn or IHG in the future."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,5.0,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The hotel was modern, and clean. I had a good check in and check out experience. There is no on-site parking but I was able to find street parking around the block with little effort on both nights. I never did find the breakfast from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. but maybe I just didn‚Äôt know where to look for it. I would stay here again."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,"I was assigned to a room without a functioning shower. The front desk did not change my room or provide any remedy for the issue. I have tried to call and email multiple times about my disappointing stay, but have not received any response. I have never stayed at such a poorly run IHG property and I highly recommend staying elsewhere."
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,Bullet proof glass at front desk.   Screaming babies in the lobby.  30 people waiting to check in and just one employee available.  45 minutes wait to check in.

Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,5.0,The location was ideal for what we needed. Walking distance to the airtrain. Room was clean and comfortable. Will use again on my next trip.
Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,2.0,"This hotel should be considered a last resort, in my opinion. First of all, it's located in a sketchy area of town, and I mean it really borders on questionable. If you're familiar with New York City and the way certain areas can be, it might not seem too bad. However, if you're visiting from outside the city, you'll probably find it shocking, especially at night.  Also, there is no parking, period. No parking lot, no garage, no dedicated parking of any sort. So if you have a car, good luck finding a parking spot in the street.

Secondly, the rooms are just okay. They resemble the typical rooms you'd find in a Holiday Inn, but I think the size is smaller than the usual Holiday Inn setup. The breakfast experience was terrible. They were practically out of everything except for eggs, sausages, and some pastries. More importantly, if you're unlucky enough to get a room on an upper floor, you'll end up waiting for the elevator for ten to fifteen minutes, particularly in the morning. This is because the hotel has quite a few floors‚Äîaround seven or eight, I believe‚Äîand housekeeping staff use the elevators to move around with their carts, leaving little availability for guests.

While it wasn't a major issue for me since I enjoy using the stairs, it can be quite an ordeal if you have luggage and are trying to leave in the morning. Overall, I'm not sure how this establishment manages to maintain the Holiday Inn franchise name. This review is from someone who has visited probably a hundred Holiday Inn hotels throughout the country."

Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,5.0,"I booked this hotel since it was close to the airport (JFK). Come to find out, we were actually flying into Laguardia. We took the free bus to the E train and getting to the hotel from Laguardia was very easy. We also took the train into Times Square-straight shot. The hotel appears to be newer and our room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. The location is in proximity to the train and many small restaurants and delis. We got hot sandwiches from the small deli across the street, which were inexpensive and delicious. The breakfast the next morning was nice and all that was needed, fruit, eggs, bacon, toast, yogurt, etc. I would stay in this hotel again."

Holiday Inn Express Jamaica - Jfk Airtrain - Nyc by IHG,1.0,"I made a reservation that I couldn't keep for reasons beyond my control. I reported the problems I had getting to the hotel with support, but they never responded to my messages and charged me the full rate. It's a disgrace that they didn't respect my situation and didn't have the courtesy to even respond to my message. I'm a frequent traveler, and this hotel chain is off my radar for future trips.

It's even more regrettable that I only received a response after writing the bad review, which you called fake and shifting responsibility to Booking. I wrote to you through Booking so everyone would be aware of what happened, but I never received a response from you. You can't use the search engine as an excuse, since you are the ones who set the charges on the platform. Other accommodations respond immediately through the means provided by the search platforms.

I'm leaving the evidence with the photo. Let's see who's lying, Booking or you."

I requested clean towels and reported an issue with the HVAC unit making noise and giving off a burning smell, but neither was addressed. I didn‚Äôt get to try the breakfast.

Due to my travel I couldn't fall asleep, as soon as I did, there was the front desk calling me for the wake up call! I was very grateful as I would have probably slept through my phone alarm.

The beds are super clean with silky cotton sheets. Ac room. Big clean modern bathroom. It looks like a scary by the hour hotel on the outside esp since the part of 39st looks like some side street esp at night. I had a very compact room I‚Äôm not sure if it would be too tight for 2 people u less you spend most of the day doing stuff and just come to shower and sleep. Little closet in room as well and desk. Also mini microwave and small refrigerator. I had things I forgot ordered and delivered from Walgreens with zero issues right to my door as well. Hope it stays nice and clean like this. A.

King Hotel Brooklyn Sunset Park,2.0,"A cleaner  entered the room in the late evening, I told her that I extended my stay and showed her my working key. Then the manager knocked on my door and requested my ID....They completely ruined my night, gave me a panic attack, as I have social anxiety and not dealing well with unexpected knocks on my door and being interigated.  Also I know that I paid for peace and privacy, didn't receive that, the refund was refused. If it happened at an Airbnb I would have been refunded and the host would have be kicked off the platform. I chose to stay at the hotel for privacy....bad choice....Overpriced for it's location, it 's next to the cemetery. No businesses on the block or around the corners. You need to walk at least 10 minutes to get coffee, there are no coffee machines in rooms, and no coffee in the lobby."
King Hotel Brooklyn Sunset Park,5.0,"While the King Hotel Brooklyn Sunset Park offers budget-friendly rates and a convenient location, I only complaint about the bathroom tile was dirty and I barley sleep due to noises issues, also parking is very hard even though they have couple parking spots, It's advisable to consider these factors when planning your stay. If you check in early or check out late fees are charged bring toothpaste and soap they have some liquid soap but they not smell good. Otherwise the price is very reasonably."

Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Marriott Residence Inn New York JFK is such a great spot to stay in. This is my 2nd time staying and yet again - the service did not disappoint! Located just 10 mins drive from JFK airport, the hotel was absolutely perfect for our late night arrival stay.

The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service which departs from Federal circle. Simply take the air-train from JFK airport to Federal circle and then exit on floor minus 1 to get to the shuttle area. Shuttles arrive and depart every 30 minutes and have about 8 seats ‚Äì making it a nice convenient and great value for money option for those on a budget.

We stayed in a kitchenette Queen room which was clean and modern and had all the home from home amenities we needed such as cutlery, a microwave, fridge and vanity kit.  The hotel also has complimentary water in the room and coffee machine for those in need of a caffeine fix!

For those on a budget ‚Äì the hotel offers complimentary breakfast which is hugely filling.  Lasting from 7am through to 9am, there is something for everyone ‚Äì bagels, cream cheese, jelly/jam, scrambled eggs, fruit, turkey burgers and sausages all of which can be washed down with a refreshing glass of water or tea coffee.  The kitchen staff also are kind enough to offer takeout cutlery /boxes which is perfect for those trying to make an early morning flight! All in all ‚Äì this perfectly located hotel stay was great and its very easy to get to midtown New York from ( a train from Jamaica goes straight to NY Penn station ) making this a great choice for a hotel stay close to JFK airport!

PS: Special shout out to Remy on the valet counter who helped with all our luggage and became a buddy of my son!"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,This hotel was amazing! We only stayed one night due to our flight out of JFK being cancelled. The free shuttle service to and from airport was super convenient. Emily was at the front desk when we arrived. She was super friendly and helpful. We were in an extremely frustrating situation and Emily turned it around for us. Emily deserves a raise! Thank you!

ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÇÿ®ÿßŸÑ ŸÜŸÅÿ≥Ÿäÿ©"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Nicole and Sean and the entire staff and the hotel are easily 5 star!   One of the best hotels i have ever stayed at!!!!!
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"We stayed here overnight for a layover, and I honestly can‚Äôt say enough good things about this hotel. Shortly after booking, I received a detailed email from the guest service agent with all the information we could need ‚Äî breakfast hours, housekeeping, fitness center, Wi-Fi, and details about the 24-hour complimentary shuttle (including a super convenient QR code to request a pickup).

Check-in was smooth, and we were able to schedule our shuttle for the next morning right at the front desk. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and professional. The room itself was spacious, spotless, and very comfortable.

Breakfast was complimentary and far better than the usual hotel fare ‚Äî plenty of variety and surprisingly high quality. And the shuttle service was excellent: timely, organized, and they dropped us off right at our terminal ‚Äî not at a general shuttle stop like some places do. From the hotel to the terminal took less than 15 minutes, even in morning traffic.

I don't think I have ever stayed in a more efficiently ran hotel. Would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it for anyone needing to stay near JFK."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Breakfast buffet, not so great.  Went across the street to the other Marriott, 2 martinis, and an order of chicken wings for dinner $,72. That's just crazy, but that's new york.I guess.

Staff was extremely nice.

I was given a voucher for 2 nights because my flight got canceled, was a good place to stay for a couple nights."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,I had to edit my past review  just stayed there again for my 2nd stay. Much different from my 1st experience.On  both check in and out experiences the staff seems lost and like they didn't want to be there. I WOULD NEVER COME HERE AGAN!

Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"One of newest hotels near New York area
From welcoming , delicious breakfast (free too ^^) , shuttle bus service to JFK airport
All perfect !
Worth of paying little higher rate than other hotels
Loved it and if we have to fly to Europe or Asia
I would be back definitely"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"this is a very upscale hotel, my immediate family and i always stay here whenever we have to travel from the jersey shore to queens. the hotel is large, clean, and spacious, rooms are also sanitized and aesthetically pleasing to see.

during our most recent stay (6‚Ä¢27‚Ä¢25 -  6‚Ä¢28‚Ä¢25), there was an incident where the door broke, we would try and close the door but it would not close, posing a saftey issue to the persons staying in the room. the man came and fixed it, and it was okay until about 7a the next morning. the same incident occured, and another man came and fixed it again. service was quick and the employees served with full smiles.

breakfast options were pretty diverse! i've never been to a hotel where there are varieties of scrambled eggs. even seasoned eggs! amazing. even the fro t desk ladies were all smiles.

the only downside was the lobby elevator situated to the left, it was acting weird which made me feel very paranoid, espescially because my seasoned grandmother was also in the  elevator. however there was an employee inside assisting with the operation.

personally, i like big cities and the queens area, but queens is defenetley not for everyone."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Shuttle service is so convenient and easy to use, the drivers were very helpful with loading/unloading my luggage, all the front desk staff were outstanding with directions & recommendations (special shout out to Muhammad for walking me to the bus stop since I felt nervous & explaining how to use the bus for the first time), rooms are amazingly clean, well thought out, and so comfortable to crash in at the end of a very busy day in the city. Every convenience was thought of. Can‚Äôt wait to stay at another Marriott (both Residence Inn & Element were fabulous stays)! Element in NY even had a handicap accessible chairlift for the pool! Complimentary breakfast was healthy and good. Thanks to all who made my stay at both hotels wonderful!"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"From the time of booking to check out, I have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel and its staff! Nicole and Emily were extremely kind, helpful and welcoming. They went above and beyond to make sure my friends and I had an amazing stay as I kicked off my birthday travel plans."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Truly the best experience I've had at a hotel in a while. I was staying in NY for one night with my mom and daughters.  We were there for a close relative's funeral. Before I even got there, communication was great, but when I arrived, Nicole at the front desk, and Mark a Supervisor, delivered an unparalleled check-in.  I am always staying at hotels for work, and although I have good experiences all the time,  I have never had an experience where service, professionalism, kindness and care were consistent at a hotel. Every single person i interacted with, was helpful and pleasant.
The rooms are also modern and clean.
The following day the front desk staff also went above and beyond for us.
My family and I are grateful for our experience, and I highly recommend this hotel"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"The hotel was awesome, very close to the airport, great breakfast, clean, and awesome staff! Emily and Nicole are the BEST! They helped us plan a great time and were very accommodating!"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Best front desk and staff is super friendly!
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"This is (by-far) the worst customer friendly hotel there is... it only takes one or 2 events to make it a 1 star hotel.

I arrived late on Friday night (6/27/2025) after an exhausting long work day. As I valet my car and entered the lobby, I noticed several patrons with long faces; I knew this was a bad sign of things to come.
I headed to the front desk for my keys, and they said their computer system was down. They could  NOT issue keys because of this.
It made me curious because other professional Marriot properties make a key when you do a mobile check-in.

Either way, when I ask other people how long they have been waiting, the answer shocked me
...over 2 hours, and by the time I decided to call it quits (after 2 hours of my own) and get another hotel, those individuals were waiting. As far as I know, the system failed at 10 pm and wasn't back up until 1 pm the next day.

This lack of preparation by hotel management is sad and does not represent Marriot values. I hope they get their act together and find a backup plan if the system fails again.

I (a titanium elite for life) will NEVER stay at this property....their staff laughed as us patrons were tired, hungry, and had early flights the next day.

After a few legal threats, my points  used (for the stay) were returned to my account.

Please use caution when thinking about using this facility!"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Rough looking neighborhood but everything was wonderful. I stayed one night.
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"It was really nice to stay in a clean, and efficiently run hotel.  I requested an extra blanket after midnight and it was at the door in under 10 minutes.  I have never had that at other hotels.  I loved the clean and orderly layout in the breakfast area too. Staff top notch! Great love to Kevin the front desk supervisor for making us feel like our friends were taking care of us. I joined Marriott because of this experience üíï"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"One of the best run airport hotels I have been to in years. If you love the Residence Inn brand and you appreciate a well run hotel you will enjoy this one. A clear shuttle schedule and tracking, a friendly front desk, tea and coffee at the ready. What more does one need from an airport hotel."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Best hotel my airline has put us in to date. I definitely hope we continue to stay here. It was an amazing place. And the fitness center is amazing. Love it!! The breakfast in the morning was really good also.
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"From checkin to check out, this is one of the best hotel experience my family and I have had. Kevin at the front desk made early checkin possible, based on availability. The valet team was fast and reliable when we were late to the wedding we were attending. Sean from the breakfast team made the kids comfortable and out experience awesone. We will return!"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Everything about this place was spectacular. The only complaint is that we couldn‚Äôt stay longer. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was delicious. The room was brand new and pristinely clean easy to park nearby. Very quiet.
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"The rooms are clean and so far havent had any issues with their cleanliness.
However I would recommend a lock for the bathroom door. Also having some hooks for hanging clothes in the bathroom would be ideal"
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"Very nice hotel to stay for a stoppover near JFK. Breakfast location is small and time frame is very short, 7 to 9:30. Elevators are used by service as well, they could have a separate one. Rooms are nice and spacious, seem to have been renewed recently. The fridges in the rooms make a disturbing noise from time to time I‚Äôd be back if I had a flight to catch it‚Äôs good for short stays! Shuttle service works well and it‚Äôs just 5 min drive to JFK."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,3.0,Just an FYI. It's another $50 for Valet Parking and then theres parking tax of $5.17 and a whole bunch of other charges besides the room charge. So a room for $283 will cost you $383 and the view was of a huge heep of garbage. Very disappointing
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Day staff 10/10. Never been more warmly recognized as Gold Elite at any property. Efficient. Room very, very clean. Excellent hot water and pressure. Free shuttle was reliable and timely. Night staff looked at me like I had 5 heads when I asked for a food delivery recommendation at 11.45 pm."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Very clean and friendly staff after a long flight. I would highly recommend staying here again. Very convenient to the airport and shuttle bus service is on time!
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,3.0,<NA>
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"At least one person at the front desk was such a liar.

No shuttle for the hotel at JFK, waited 45 minutes, no shuttle came, multiple calls made to confirm, but still no shuttle came.

So we took the shuttle from Hampton Inn next door and came to the hotel.

Told the front desk person about it and he offered 1K points at compensation so we took it, and whatever, 1K points can barely be worth a cup of coffee.

Guess what? Of course he even lied about 1K points, there were no points for compensation at all after check out and even after a whole week, and after a whole month."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Very clean, comfortable spacious rooms.  The front desk staff person was friendly and efficient. The hotel has a free shuttle to JFK that leaves every 15 mins. The Residence Inn shares a driveway with the JFK Marriott Hotel which has a nice bar restaurant if you need to grab lunch or dinner."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"WOW!  I was surprised.   Needed to be in Queens for an early morning meeting.   Had points so picked out a room.  I was tired and a little grumpy after a long day.  Kevin started to check me in and with a smile and a great personality.  Then Iris jumped in with a few little funny remarks.   They turned my frown upside down.  Took elevator and got into my room.   Much nicer than expected.   Large,  modern,  clean and very comfortable.   Wouldn't  hesitate to recommend this hotel. (have about 600 nights at Marriott's)    I've seen my share.  THANK   MARTIN
PS the next time I'm flying out of JFK I will stay there.  Park on street for the weekend  and just take the shuttle to the airport from the hotel."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,We were waiting for hotel vans for more than one hour because they only pick up new reservations people. This is unacceptable! Horrible service!
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Clean rooms nice transportation for free from the terminal
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Our flight was cancelled so BA put us up in this hotel for the night. When we opened the door we were so surprised it was like a mini apartment. There was a kitchen area, microwave, coffee maker, fridge and a dishwasher! We had two double beds, a large TV, usb and plug sockets, a desk, large TV and tub chairs. The bathroom was also fabulous with a selection of clean towels and toiletries. There was no food served here, not sure if it was too late but you can get food at the hotel opposite, another JFK residency hotel and there is a bar if you need a drink. We asked for a wake up call for 5.30 and got one at 3.15 not sure why and we didn't get a 5.30 call but it didn't matter we had an alarm on the phone. Overall a lovely hotel, very clean, helpful friendly staff and I would stay there again."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Great service from all the employees! Convenient hotel close to JFK. Only downfall is that the rooms are smaller than what Residence Inn offers.
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Stayed one night while traveling to Europe. Amazing night! Clean room, delicious breakfast with healthy options, and friendly staff. I would definitely stay here if I was traveling to NY again."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"The hotel was remodeled and now under a different hotel chain.

I do like the look of the lobby and the front desk area. Well designed and nice color scheme.

There's free breakfast for all guests, and it was really good.

I had a king bed and 4 pillows in my room. Beds and pillows were very comfortable.

Had a little kitchenette with 2 stove tops, a larger mini fridge, and a large microwave.

Only downfall, nothing in the surrounding area when it comes to dining or convenient stores."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,2.0,"1 night layover at NY!

Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,Poor service. Breakfast is horrible. The staff seems very inexperienced and rough. I have stayed in this area  and manhattan many times. This is the worst breakfast experience at a Marriott (Residence inn) in a while. Breads are out and they won‚Äôt refill. Coffee and creamer is running low and the staff won‚Äôt refill. These guys are standing around 20 mins before close to get ready to take away things as fast as possible. Poor service.
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Free JFK airport shuttle, soft comfortable beds, friendly staff, modern lobby, safe (keycard access only to the elevator to your floor) and coffee, hot chocolate and flavored water in the lobby lounge."
Residence Inn by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"No frills, cheap, clean, and surprisingly good service. Breakfast buffet is solid and included. Usually stay here on a stopover coming from oversees before making the last flight home. The shuttle comes on demand and they can usually get you late checkout."

The bartender, clearly intoxicated with alcohol, tried to charge me $40 for two beers when it was time to pay. I paid with a $20 bill and a $5 bill, but he claimed I only gave him $6. I asked him to check the cameras to avoid any misunderstanding, but he proceeded to open another beer without my consent. To avoid further trouble, I decided to give him another $20. I hope this situation gets clarified. Room 2311"
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,5.0,"Francheska at the front desk was absolutely outstanding. From the moment I arrived, she greeted me with warmth and professionalism that set the tone for my entire stay. She remembered my name and even offered great local recommendations.

Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,1.0,"Travelled to the US with my friend as we both turned 30 this year. Enjoyed our stay here and initially would have recommended. The location was convenient, the rooms were small but for 2 it was fine and they were always beautifully cleaned when we came back from being out all day. Whilst I was there I made an order from an online shop anticipating it would arrive in time, but unfortunately it arrived the day after we checked out and left New York. I told the reception at check out that I would have a delivery after we left and they wrote down an email for me to email once the parcel arrived so I could organise a pickup with DHL and have it shipped to me. The parcel is actually in my friend‚Äôs name as she booked the room and it‚Äôs a birthday present for her. I told the reception these details too. It‚Äôs now been 3 weeks since I first emailed and I am nowhere closer to finding my parcel because the sheer lack of communication from the front desk. I have emailed 7 times and received 2 replies in total and have also made the international call to the front desk too and when I finally get a response via email it‚Äôs very short and has not helped locate my parcel, although when I called, the man I spoke to said they did have a record of it and it was just a matter of finding it?! The situation is ridiculously frustrating and the blatant ignoring of emails is concerning. I am now reaching out in the hopes someone can contact me to help rectify the issue."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,5.0,Staff friendly. Love the lemon water in lobby. Rooms - beds comfortable & bathrooms clean.
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,5.0,"The location of the hotel is great. I‚Äôm from NYC and the seaport was my hangout spot as a child, it did not disappoint. It‚Äôs very close to the BK bridge for a walk and near the train station. The staff was friendly and the rooftop bar is very cute. I would recommend."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,3.0,"I booked a room with a double bed - decent size. Beds are comfortable and the room is clean. AC is operational however the hallway is humid and warm.  Only 2 elevators. Gym is fair - 2 treadmills, free weights, elliptical, and bike. Outside attracts loitering and the garbage stacks up directly in front of the hotel."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,4.0,"My stay was great, as this is 3 star hotel but really neat and clean, room space acceptable, front desk staff was really helpful. Breakfast was Ok."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,5.0,"My daughter and I spent a week at Four Points at Sheraton, 6 Platt St., and it was an excellent experience. When we got into our room, we noticed that the AC was not responding to the thermostat setting. When I went down to speak with the front desk, Carlos and Darryl guaranteed me that either it would be fixed in the morning or we would be moved. In the morning, Freddie (engineer extraordinaire) came and fixed the AC while we were at breakfast. He is amazing! Carlos and Darryl are extremely responsive and all of our interactions with front desk staff were superior. Furthermore, the rooms are serviced daily and immaculate. I will certainly return to this hotel! THANK YOU for making our stay so wonderful and feel like home. By the way, the location is perfect for a foodie!"
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,5.0,Very good and safe location near from many points of interest and the rooms are spacious

Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,5.0,Had a really good experience! Friendly staff. The gym is quite nice! Location is excellent. Can recommend!
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,1.0,"I was not impressed with this hotel at all. Half of the staff are nice, but the men at the front desk definitely need to be looked into. The first night we checked in our hotel was out of AC and they did not tell us this and whenever I went to the front desk to ask, one of the gentlemen told me that it was a whole building issue and then the other gentleman told me it was my unit issue. Well, anyways, we could not have any of these issues as for I have health problems and so does my friend‚Äòs brother who was staying with us. So arguing with the staff, Definitely did not help my high blood pressure either. Just avoid this hotel at all cost."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,5.0,"Good hotel as you would expect as part of the Marriott chain
More affordable so not super glamorous but functional and comfortable
Great rooftop bar
Good service but not the Ritz or Westin but great for the price
Great location for Seaport.Pier 17 and Tin Building
Enjoy"
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,3.0,"UPDATE: Adam the manager did a great job of rectifying the situation.

Original: Wish I could give ZERO stars. Came here after booking and pre-paying and they said they sold out of rooms. Sleazy management. I am Bonvoy Titanium status also."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,4.0,"Staff is really lovely. I made a mistake with my reservation and they helped me fix it without any hassle. The rooms are clean but very no-frills. Location is low-key great which I wasn't expecting since I booked this hotel cheaply for points. People complain about construction and nightlife noises, but I was on a lower floor and had no issue. The closed windows block out sound just fine. My two complaints would be the lighting in the rooms (extremely harsh and uncomfortable--why not just offer one or two soft yellow lamps?) and the fact that lobby smelled bad consistently. Seems like something it wouldn't be difficult to fix."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,5.0,"Thank you to this Marriott for being our home away from home! Everything far exceeded our expectations. Room was perfect, clean, temp stayed excellent. Water pressure was on point, water stayed warm for us to both shower each night. Anything we requested was sent right up to the room. We talked with 4 or 5 different people at front desk during our stay and all of them were exceptionally helpful! We got there early on check in day and they held our bags for us to go eat while the room got ready. Then on check out day they held them again for us so we could check out some cool stuff till time to catch our plane home. Best stay ever. Can't think of a single thing I would recommend to improve. I had seen other reviews about noise, but we never heard anything from outdoors nor from other rooms."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,5.0,"Excellent!
Location - access to many metro and rail lines, quiet, clean, we have been located on 22nd floor.
Complimentary coffee and water."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,1.0,"Saw rats outside the hotel entrance‚Äîcompletely unacceptable. The room was dirty, tiny, and had a musty smell. The shower had barely any water pressure. There was no fridge in the room, which was very inconvenient. I stayed for two nights, and the air conditioning often didn‚Äôt work. The air was stuffy and there was no ventilation, making it hard to sleep. On top of that, the Wi-Fi connection was down most of the time, which made things even worse. I called the front desk several times, but they failed to fix the AC or offer a room change. Extremely frustrating experience. I do not recommend staying here at all."
Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown,3.0,"Well, my experience with the stat was not that great. Very small size rooms for a group of 4 members, if you are alone or just 2 this is an amazing place to stay at, however if more then 2 don't consider this hotel. The rooms are very small. Bathroom is also small which is understandable as it's in NYC Downtown area. The service is amazing and the location is safe even if it's the middle of the night"

M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),5.0,"The rooms have been heavily updated very recently. The bathrooms are still slightly dated. It was cleaner than most NYC hotels BUT getting inside is a pain while it undergoes renovation as the main entrance is closed.

Service was great and our room was cleaned each and every day.

Location is absolutely phenomenal and probably one of the best places to stay if you want to be close to one of the most famous landmarks in the world and have access to the metro right next-door."
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),5.0,<NA>
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),4.0,"I‚Äôve been staying at this hotel since before it was called InSocial ‚Äî back when it was part of the Hilton chain, and even during the Millennium Downtown days. It‚Äôs been my go-to NYC hotel since 2016, especially for trips with my family (wife and two kids). The location? üî• Can‚Äôt beat it.

I always request a high-floor, corner king room facing the Oculus, and trust me, the views are spectacular ‚Äî perfect for July 4th fireworks, river sights, and even a peek into Manhattan. If you‚Äôre heading to Jersey, it‚Äôs extremely convenient ‚Äî with multiple train lines just steps away and the Oculus transportation hub directly across the street. Even the Apple Store is right there in the same complex. Want to walk the Brooklyn Bridge? Done that many times ‚Äî 10 to 15-minute walk tops.

Rooms are spacious enough for a family. We always felt comfortable. But here are a few honest gripes:
‚Ä¢	The pool has been closed for years ‚Äî I‚Äôve never seen it open since the pandemic.
‚Ä¢	Microwaves cost extra, which caught me off guard during a family stay.
‚Ä¢	Only two elevators, so you might wait a bit, especially if you‚Äôre on the higher floors.

There‚Äôs a Starbucks right at the corner, which is super clutch for coffee in the morning. There‚Äôs also a bar on-site, but I‚Äôve never eaten there ‚Äî so I can‚Äôt speak to the food.

Management changes hands often, so each stay feels slightly different. Sometimes the pricing feels steep, other times it‚Äôs fair depending on the season. But for the location, views, and easy transit access, it‚Äôs still a solid pick for tourists, families, and solo travelers alike.

Pro tips:
‚Ä¢	Book the corner room with the Oculus view.
‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt expect a microwave unless you pay extra.
‚Ä¢	Use the location to your advantage ‚Äî shopping, food, trains, and sights all within walking distance.

Final Verdict: Above average. Not perfect, but consistent enough that I kept coming back for nearly 10 years. Name might have changed, but the location still delivers. You won‚Äôt be disappointed."

After a 5 night stay I came home to find a charge on my credit card. I emailed the hotel about this and I was told me I‚Äôd get a refund. A partial refund came through and I enquired about the remaining balance, then came the radio silence, even after 5 emails to the Reservations. ( one reply said my concern was raised to management)

In the end I had to go to my bank to get a charge back on my account for the balance. I then emailed for a 6th time again, asking for explanation on the charge and why no one replied to my emails. I also included the front desk manager in the email, again no reply.

I had even said in my email I don‚Äôt hold much hope for reply, and I was correct.

One saving grace was an employee, Timothy Lopez, who assisted in getting my wife's watch after she had forgotten upon our departure.

Hopefully someone from the hotel will reply!"

Unfortunately, we had continuous issues with breakfast. Since there was currently no breakfast room available, we had to order breakfast to our room every day.
We discussed the breakfast already upon arrival and mentioned that it was included in our booking via Booking.com.
The next day, I went to the reception again to ask what the daily rate for ordering breakfast would be ‚Äî and now comes the best part:
At checkout, we were presented with a bill for the breakfast. We then spent half an hour discussing this, as it had clearly been booked as included.
This was confirmed to us on-site, but then came the unpleasant surprise: despite the verbal confirmation, the amount was charged to us.
Now we‚Äôve been waiting for a refund for three months. This is honestly a joke.
Booking.com initially asked us for an invoice ‚Äî which we obviously didn‚Äôt have, because we had already agreed on-site that we wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for breakfast.
Now we‚Äôre hoping for competent support from Booking.com."

M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),1.0,"Beware of bait-and-switch tactics at Millennium Downtown NYC

I booked my stay a month in advance for a Renovated Panoramic Corner King ‚Äì Brooklyn Bridge View ‚Äì High Floor. Instead, I was given a much smaller, cheaper room facing a concrete wall on the 30th floor. When I complained to management, they ‚Äúresolved‚Äù the issue by moving me to an even smaller room ‚Äî all while still charging me the premium rate for one of their most expensive suites.

Since I was here for business and the location mattered, I accepted the manager‚Äôs promise of a refund upon checkout. He also had me sign up for their rewards program and spin a wheel, where I ‚Äúwon‚Äù 2,500 points ‚Äî which I never received. Instead, I was spammed with marketing emails. The so-called ‚Äúrefund‚Äù turned out to be nothing more than waiving service charges, not an actual adjustment to the nightly rate. This is extremely unethical and feels like outright fraud.

The property itself is in poor condition. Elevators were frequently out of service, at times taking nearly an hour to get to the lobby. Parts of the entrance were under repair, forcing guests through a cramped, decrepit hallway. Despite calling ahead for early check-in and being told my room would be ready, I was forced to leave my luggage with the bellman ‚Äî who sarcastically told me, ‚ÄúGood luck with that‚Äù ‚Äî and my room wasn‚Äôt available until after 4 PM. And as mentioned, it wasn‚Äôt even the room I booked.

In short, they overbooked, downgraded me to a room currently listed at 1/3 less per night, and still charged the full premium price.

I will not be staying here again or with this chain, and I strongly advise anyone considering it to proceed with caution."
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),5.0,"My family and I had a wonderful experience staying at this hotel for the second time in 13 years. We had booked a room to ring in our daughter's 21st and had requested for a high floor. They accommodated that request and gave us the 52nd floor with the best views possible. We requested for a late check out and Denise at the front desk was most helpful .  The rooms are spic and span, the service outstanding, the views breathtaking and the location is unmatched. Will recommend it to everyone."
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),5.0,"We loved our stay. After 15 years in Dubai I have no expectations from Amercan hotels . Reconstruction is a bit uncomfortable due to no parking on site, but manageable.  The room was awesome, the service, the view. We opted out from breakfasts as there are plenty of places around. I loved minimalistic, modern concept. Coffee, minifridge, packed bathroom, everything was great."
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),4.0,Good overall location in the financial district.  The river view from my room was excellent. Very helpful staff from the doorman /bellhop and up. With the construction going on the ground floor though entering the hotel can be bit of a turn off until you reach the lobby/reception area.
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),2.0,"Had a great stay here, and I wish I only had nice things to say. I hadn‚Äôt stayed here since pre-COVID when it was the Millennium Hilton. The room was spacious and nicely decorated, the bed and pillows were great, Internet worked great‚Ä¶ all good things about the stay.

They kinda screwed me on the parking situation, though. I got the Park and Play add-on when I booked the room, which prepays for your parking in a nearby garage for the duration of your stay. They don‚Äôt give you any information ahead of time on how that package works, and I had to call and ask where to park while I was in my way into the city. The garage is a couple blocks away, so I parked and got my ticket from the garage, then went to check in at the hotel. I told the desk person I got the Park and Play package, and asked what we needed to do for that; she put a stamp on my garage ticket and told me I was all set.

When I checked out a couple days later, I lugged all my stuff back over to the parking garage, only to be told that the stamp just got me a discounted rate. For the prepaid package, I needed some entirely different voucher from the hotel that the hotel never mentioned or gave me. It was hot, I had a bunch of bags, and not all the time in the world, so rather than schlepping all the way back to the hotel, I wound up having to pay $130 to get my car back and get in the road.

I contacted the hotel multiple times and ways, over a few weeks, seeking either reimbursement of the $130 or a refund of the extra fee for the parking package I was denied, and I have been ignored.

So, nice hotel in a great location for a good price‚Ä¶ but buyer beware on the add-ons. They will stiff you and they will not make it right.

ADDENDUM: They never sent me a receipt for the stay, which I need for my expense report at work. I have now called the hotel asking for it four times.
I called last week, and they said it would be emailed to me.
I called a few hours later when it hadn't, and they said there was a problem with the email, and they'd text it to me.
I called a few hours later when that hadn't shown up either, and they said there was a problem with their email and they'd send it another way. They didn't.
Now it's five days later, and I tried one more time. Sat on hold for five minutes. Then the phone rang a bunch of times with no answer. Then it dropped me into a voicemail that was full, so I couldn't leave a message.
So, roll the dice on this place if you want, but my experience is that if there's a problem, they do not care at all and will make no attempt to fix it. (See their response below: not even an apology, and no intent to actually make it right.)"

M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),1.0,"UPDATE: The checkin person actually made a new reservation because their system was down when I checked in so my existing one incurred a NO SHOW FEE OF $180 without DISCLOSING or CORRECTING it. I have been calling the hotel every other day for the past 2 weeks and am still waiting for a response back from the hotel manager. What a waste of time. So I had a pleasent front desk person who ended up overcharging me $180 -> ZERO STARS.

Checkin - system was down, think they were migrating things from Millenium to MSocial. Front desk had to manually check me in. However, the front desk person I interacted with was very pleasent.
Lobby - undergoing reno, so was drab to walk through.
Rooms - nice/newly renovated

Reason for 1 star:
One week later, noted higher charge of $180 than my invoice via hotels.com. Tried to reach out to get this corrected but:
1) Phone lines not working, virtual assistance directs to front desk line which nobody picks up, inbox for messages is full so can't even leave a message
2) Website does not even load - not sure if due to the hotel transition, but still unacceptable.

Around 11:30 pm after another contact with guest services, we were notified that the hotel ran out of bedding.

Day 2. We contacted guest services to see if bedding was available.  They assured us that they would take care of it. On our return to the hotel after our day out, still no bedding.

Das Highlight war tats√§chlich nur die Aussicht: Wir hatten ein Eckzimmer mit zwei gro√üen Fensterfronten ‚Äì der Blick √ºber die Stadt war beeindruckend.

Now, a week later, the hotel has completely denied the agreement and refuses to refund anything. Booking called and wrote them. Wow! Crazy!

Just adding more comments as this hotel is weird: they will not clean your room unless you ask them to do it.

Adding pictures of hairs left on the wall of the bathroom from the previous occupant."
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),2.0,"The location was great and the staff was very friendly, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying at this hotel‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre traveling with kids. The bathroom was dirty, and the TV had a very poor image quality. They don‚Äôt offer access to Netflix or Amazon Prime, which makes things harder when you have young children. They do offer kids‚Äô movies and shows, but you have to pay for each one ($21.99 per movie and $3.99 per episode). There are currently no restaurants on-site, and if your reservation includes breakfast, it‚Äôs delivered via room service. I‚Äôve stayed in much better places in New York"
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),1.0,Es la segunda vez que me hospedo y esta segunda vez me hicieron un cargo por 1249 USD investigando me enviaron que $1000 USD son una ‚ÄúMulta‚Äù por ‚ÄúFumar‚Äù y lo peor del caso es que NO SOY FUMADORA. Es un hotel deshonesto ya que tienen un reporte de que se fumo en la habitaci√≥n a una hora donde yo me encontraba fuera de la habitaci√≥n y del hotel. En verdad lean las rese√±as y NO se hospeden aqu√≠. Ev√≠tense problemas. Me est√°n estafando con $1000 USD.
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),4.0,"stayed 6 nights, refurbished rooms are great, staff friendly. Ofcourse they are renovating lobby etc, but it's not a big thing for the guests. Only negative remark is the elevators. They should have more, especially when not all working. Waiting time could be up to 10 min. Overall great hotel on superb location"
M Social Hotel New York Downtown (formerly Millennium Downtown New York),1.0,"Never got the bond back from the hotel, which is more then 200 USD. Nothing that we broke, neither did we make any noise!! It‚Äôs over 3 months now, and still they fail to give us the money back or contact us back. DONT GO HERE!! No communication from their side, it‚Äôs unbelievable and we are really upset with their service. Would not recommend at all, save your money and stay somewhere else. Never experienced anything like this before. It‚Äôs unacceptable and unbelievable!!!!"

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",4.0,I was only there for the pool.
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",3.0,"Pros:
-AMAZING shower pressure
-AMAZING view
-Comfortable beds
-Clean sheets
-Vanity mirror
-You can play the sound coming from the TV inside the bathroom
-Good location, right next to Chelsea Market
-Friendly staff
-White noise machine
-Fast Wi-Fi
-Cafe and bar right downstairs
-Front desk provided us with water bottles when we asked

Cons:
-Toilet was very tall. I am 5'4 and was on my tippy toes
-Fridge was filled by the hotel so we couldn't utilize it with our own drinks
-When we went to check out at around 6:45am, the hallway on the 10th floor was blocked off by a door. We tried calling the front desk but they didn't answer. We tried pushing it but didn't want to break anything. Eventually, we figured it out ourselves but it was unusual, a bit of an inconvenience, and quite honestly dangerous if ever there was an emergency
-Nightclub upstairs was noisy, nothing too bad but they do provide ear plugs
-We set the AC to 65 but it did not feel that cold

Bonus: If you have trypophobia, do not stay here LOL"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",4.0,"I've stayed in Dream several times for business. Check-in and check-out are always quick and easy,  and the staff are very attentive to my needs. During my last stay, they stored my luggage for free after checkout until I left, and they even got me a taxi that was cheaper than ride share (thanks Jay!)

I wish the beds were softer so I could get better sleep, but the nice overhead shower helps make up for that a bit."

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",3.0,There‚Äôs just things about this hotel that make it meh. The shampoo and conditioner bottles just don‚Äôt work. The tv doesn‚Äôt work. There‚Äôs no hgtv channel. The light switches are weird.
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"You cannot stay here with another person. The location is nice, the rooms are pretty, but there is ZERO bathroom privacy. I don't know who would stay here, but nobody traveling with a friend or partner! What's wrong with regular walls and doors?"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",4.0,"We stayed here as a group of three and booked through Priceline. At first it was a little confusing since we mistakenly booked for two instead of three, and unfortunately neither Priceline nor the hotel helped much with an upgrade or adjustment despite the higher price. That said, the view from our room overlooking Manhattan was absolutely beautiful, and the location is hard to beat‚Äîjust about a 30-minute walk to Times Square. Service could have been smoother, but at least we got complimentary umbrellas from Dream, which came in handy!"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,Check in was quick and the staff was very helpful. Perfect location. Paul was outstanding and very helpful. Jay was a pleasure to greet each day!! And courteous when packing up and departing!  We will be back to Dream again!
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"Great hotel, great location and very nice staff.
On our way out Jay was very helpful with our luggage and finding us a taxi."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",4.0,"Decent hotel in downtown - nothing amazing, usual business hotel"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",3.0,"The hotel was dated and well-used, but the staff made up for it.
The lighting controls in the rooms were hard to control and figure out, and there didn't seem to be a happy medium.
I've never used ""chainmale"" for a shower curtain before, but I guess there's always a first time.

The location was awesome for getting our, walking around, and getting dinner, breakfast, or lunch.

We felt safe, and comfortable with where we were.

The staff at the hotel were fantastic. They were attentive, well spoken, easy to understand, and clear in their questions and responses. They were very helpful and understanding."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",4.0,"I enjoyed staying at this hotel in the heart of meatpacking district just across the chelsea market. Variety of restaurants, little garden parks, piers and museums, all in all, within walking distance.  google headquarter is around the corner.  starbucks roastery is also across the street.  The hotel has interesting arts display and a small swimming pool on the rooftop is open to public.

Friday night, they had a big night club full of teenegers and young crowds, that can be noisy and door slamming in the middle of the night.

I am surprised that they don't offer the coffee machine inside the rooms.  Upon request, I received the kerig the next day and I appreciate it."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"Was not a fan of this hotel to old, stuck trying to look new but looks old. Stay away much better stays for the money. Also area smells really bad."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",2.0,"Location was great but we got in trouble by the fire safety guy in the hotel for taking a ""hot"" shower the day we were checking out.  The alarm started going off and the guy came knocking on our door saying we had to keep it open and open the window and start fanning down the vents.  I'm sorry but I'm not worried about the temp of the shower I'm taking when staying in a hotel and then having them tell me it's my fault and I need to rectify it myself.  He basically said we were entitled vacationers who should care more about the needs of the hotel. Sorry, no! Not how hospitality works."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,We decided to stay at Dream Downtown NYC. This hotel is amazing! But what makes this place standout is its amazing staff. We had the pleasure of being greeted by Sandra Beachem the Guest Experience Manager. I excitedly told Sandra that my wife and I were celebrating our 12 year wedding anniversary and she unexpectedly upgraded our room. While in our room we heard a knock on our door and to our surprise someone was at our door with a surprise!! Excellent service and experience. If you‚Äôre looking for a great place to stay in NYC‚Ä¶ look no further.
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",2.0,"Unfortunately, I wouldn't stay here again. I accompanied my boyfriend on his work trip, and for the cost of the room, it was a disappointing experience. To begin with, the AC was not working. The thermostat was set at 65 degrees, but it definitely was not that cool in our room. We didn't receive consistent hospitality services -- one day they didn't give us a fresh bathmat towel or washcloths and only large towels. The toilet was also at a weird, uncomfortable height. Everything was floor to ceiling, and I understand that they wanted to seem chic and modern, but it was honestly very impractical. The shower curtain didn't close all the way, the window curtain was hard to close -- everything was just really heavy. In the bathroom, the shower head was really inconvenient for my bf; I'm pretty petite so I didn't run into this issue, but it was a detachable head and the long neck was constantly in his way while in the shower and no way to secure it out of the way. The bathroom sink faucet handle was also broken; if we weren't careful, it would literally detach from the faucet. I wanted to spend some time at the pool while he was at work. The pool is a huge selling point and something they boast about on their website. It turns out that unless you want to pay an additional $100 to reserve a lounge chair, you can't go between the hours of 11am and 7pm, which are the prime hours for being at a pool! They also charge you an automatic $50 fee, assuming you'll use certain services they offer, whether you actually use them or not. The one thing I did like about it was the location. It was very convenient to get around NYC. That said, this is all to say that I would not recommend staying here, especially if you're on a vacation."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"I am definitely staying at this location again- 1 Block from 14th St subway station!  150 yards from Chelsea Market!
The staff is attentive and tentative and far away from the typical uprightness‚Ä¶.O and they use a dreamy lobby scent ;)"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",3.0,Came here for a Sunday wedding. The downstairs is nice but don't check in early because they will charge you $50 on top of an extra resort fee. The rooms are small and falling apart. It is not worth the close to $400 for a Sunday night stay. Stay anywhere else.
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,garbage hotel with garbage service
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"Absolutely terrible, they don‚Äôt have AC, they don‚Äôt have fans. The front desk is covered in fans because this is obviously an issue for them as well. The ‚Äúengineer‚Äù literally stopped responding to any requests to fix it from the front desk request.

The entire floor is 80c, the place is a dump and a nightmare."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,Really pleasant stay. Stylish comfy rooms. Great location near Chelsea Market & High Line.  Nice accommodating staff. Would happily stay again.
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"This has probably been my favorite hotel experience in New York thus far. Everything about my time staying here has been exceptional. Shoutout to Jay who helped us in so many ways, hands down the best service I‚Äôve ever received. Give him a raise"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"Horrible place AVOID. The rooms are worn, smelled constantly of smoke even though we booked a nonsmoking room and opening the windows did not help at all. Housekeeping said they would bring an air filter but that never showed up. We also asked for a mini fridge and that never showed up either over the course of our 7 day stay.

Went to the pool as there was a heatwave while I was in NYC and it was disgusting - cloudy water, towels thrown all around, the pool chairs broken and worn.

You know it's bad when they have a sign in every room beside some complimentary ear buds due to the noise from the nightclub upstairs lol. We had to switch to a smaller room on a lower floor, even though we paid for a larger room due to the loud music keeping us up at night.

The $50+ amenity fee charged per night supposedly includes water bottles - which were nowhere in sight. I was also charged incorrectly for a bottle of wine from the minibar which I did not touch.....front desk and overall service was super slow, half of the time we called no one even picked up. The bathroom had a moldy smell as well....I couldn't wait to get out of there.

Just go stay somewhere else please avoid this place! Been to NYC 10+ times; this is the worst hotel I've stayed at."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"I have only great things to say about my stay @ Dream Downtown Hotel. It started off a bit complicated due to Expedia messing up our check in dates but Sarah was such a tremendous help with trying to help us situate a booking since the hotel was close to being booked out and no rooms available. Sarah made sure all our questions were answered and helped us the best way she knew how to fix our booking with Expedia. Her friendly and caring personality made a difference. Also shoutout to Robert who was so kind and accommodating to us! Also big huge plus the location is amazing,  very convenient."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",2.0,"Checking into this hotel with my friend. Sorry to say I had a bad first impression. The name is misleading, it‚Äôs anything but a dream like ambiance. Usual check in time is 3 pm, even arriving 10 minutes early shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, checking in @2:50 pm, we waited in line for about 5 mins, 2:55pm one hotel associate told us we were too early and they weren‚Äôt quite ready. In my mind is that a joke? Well clearly not. We were told to check back in about 10-15 mins on top of that we reserved 2 queens but come to find out they‚Äôre sold out and only have 1 king bed‚Ä¶..but can add a roll away bed. Checked and waited back in @3:15pm, ended being same story same day, this time with a different associate‚Ä¶. This time for our troubles they gave us 2 waters as nice as that was, we just wanted to go to our room after a longs day of travel, yet we needed to wait for anther 10-15 minutes for the room to be ready. Sitting in aggravation another 10-20 mins has passed and for a THIRD time attempted to check in around @3:40 pm, finally the room was ready. (I can guarantee that the room was ready but for some odd reason house keeping just didn‚Äôt mark it as ready)‚Ä¶.. once we got to the room of course only 1 king bed and NO roll away bed!‚Ä¶.. after heading back for shopping for 4 hrs later, came back to a roll away bed added. Of course needed to use the bathroom, yet have you tried to slide the bathroom door for privacy? Forget about it, the sliding door was heavy as hell and slide so back into the wall it couldn‚Äôt be retrieve back out, such a joke. Additional to a bad first day, the second day wasn‚Äôt any better as we headed to the pool area and as we entered a waitress stopped us and asked if we wanted to rent a lounge chair for $150 or sit in the dining area‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll let that sink in, yeah for a lounge chair just one chair it‚Äôs $150! Absolute joke. We just got some food and drinks at the dining area. Service in the pool area wasn‚Äôt any great either, 1 mix drink 1 beer can took 10 mins and the beer wasn‚Äôt even fridge cold. Also was time you enter the hotel front door it smelled like peaches and flowers but each time you go through the elevator to the lobby area it smells like sewer garbage like smell, very unsettling. Staying at the hotel for 3 days, since day 1 the bottled body soap was empty and house cleaning did come clean yet not once the shower bottle body was filled. Since this hotel is located downtown the hotel has a nightclub located on the 12th floor and of course my room was on the 11th floor‚Ä¶..they offered a sound barrier button dial to minimize the sound but it was broken and made no different, only good thing was they offered ear plugs but end up never using them‚Ä¶..add more unpleasant experiences during the stay. Only pro about this hotel was its location conveniently located in downtown NYC. Unfortunately won‚Äôt be staying here again."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"DO NOT STAY HERE - HYATT DO BETTER

I‚Äôm a New Yorker who booked 2 rooms here for my sister‚Äôs bachelorette party. The location was central to everything we wanted to do and the vibe fit a ‚Äúcool factor‚Äù of ‚Äúbachelorette party in NYC.‚Äù

First, service here is horrible and very slow. For example, I tried calling for days to see about setting up some welcome champagne in our rooms before arrival and couldn‚Äôt even get someone to answer the phone. Sadly it wasn‚Äôt much better after check in.

Second, the pool! Hotel guests can only use it in the morning and then we had to pay $150 a person for a chair. Insane!

Third, BEWARE of the noise. The con to being a ‚Äúcool‚Äù hotel is that when you‚Äôre trying to go to bed you hear drunk partying on the street until the wee hours of the am. Making sleeping, hard.

All in all I would not recommend staying here!"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",2.0,"This won't be for everyone, but the wall behind the bed is a trypophobian nightmare. I might call it a Holetel. Our window in our room also directly at the same level as the tables at the pool. I can clearly see two men right now hanging out 5 feet away from me and they can see me too. The buttons in the room are so weird there's a user guide attached to the wall. The guide literally teaches you how to turn on and off your lights because it is really not obvious. The minibar light has one of these switches but it didn't seem to work at all. The entire vibe is Stanley Kubrick's clockwork orange. So this might be for you but it really might not be for you. Convenient location though!"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"This might be the worst hyatt I have stayed. As many other review mentioned, the noise is super annoying due to the club on the 12th floor. Even when you stay at the 9th floor, you could still hear the beats until 4am. I've tried the earplugs/airpods with noise cancellation, but still did not work out..you can feel the whole building was vibrating...

Avoid this hotel especially when you are sensitive to the noise. Check the video for the noise (it‚Äôs much louder than what‚Äôs appeared in the video.)

The insane hours of the club is 10pm-4am!!!"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",2.0,"Dream Hotel should be called Nightmare Hotel. Stayed here 7/24/2025 to 7/27/2025. Get checked in and head to my room, tired and thirsty after a long trip from New Hampshire. Get in my room, bed is very low to the floor, sheets were clean but my pillows smelt of cigarettes terribly.  Try to open the fridge to have a nice cold beer, but fridge won't open. Pick up the phone to call front desk, try calling several times. In the 4 days i was there, no one ever answers the phone, when calling the front desk. Walk to the front desk to get a bucket of ice and see why my fridge won't open. Long story short Took 2 full days to get the fridge to open. Service was poor quality and inadequate customer service. They treated me as though it was my fault and i was annoying them. The pool, we were told area is operated by TAO! Did not know this before hand. The business doesn't clearly communicate this prior to your stay. When we checked in we were told there is a pool and a night club. Never had access to the night club either. We just wanted to go in and take a peek, we were told it was $100 entrance fee, but you could  use it towards your drink purchases. I asked for late check out and they changed it from 11am to 12pm, however my card shut off at 11am and i couldn't access the elevator to get back to my room, another trip to the front desk. My overall experience was terrible. Would never go back, and would never recommend it to anyone. It's Overpriced for subpar experience. Oh I did receive an apology email from them. Doesn't change or help my experience."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",2.0,"Room 224 is humid. Privacy and service button doesn‚Äôt work. I called front desk around 10:40PM and explained that I‚Äôm tired and would like it fixed soon so I can sleep. They assured me engineer will come look at it soon. Engineer arrived 15+ minutes later, pressed the buttons a few times and then said there‚Äôs nothing he can do. I called front desk to change rooms but they said there‚Äôs no rooms. I then checked the website and it clearly showed that there‚Äôs LOTS of rooms available!!! After complaining downstairs and showing them how many rooms are available at the booking website at the front desk, they‚Äôre letting me change the room.

After getting this new room, I realized that the old one also had a loud vibrating sound issue. It was probably from the broken AC. I thought it was normal, but it wasn‚Äôt. The new room had working buttons, better AC, and quieter AC humming noise. On the booking notes, I specifically asked for a room away from noise. But seems like they ignored everything and just gave me the worst room available.

I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt accept the staff‚Äôs BS and complained in person to get the room I paid so much for."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",3.0,"Far from times square.  We booked with Crystal who told us we would have access with our kids to the pool only after we checking in we were told that it is an adult only vibe,  Kids are not allowed to swim in the pool.  we asked for city view and there is no such thing.  we got a view of the building next door."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,Pool service is awful. Soiled towels. I needed a new towel and never received it. Drinks were terrible. Service was ok. This place exists for tourist.
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"Worst hotel ever. paid over $500 per night. The whole building and the room was smell like toilet and the staffs were not accommodating our problem ever. room was not clean. parking was rip off. actually had to pay more than parking at Time Square. resort fee was also very expensive.
would not recommend for family trip."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"transparent shower, could see everything. very humid no coffee maker, humid in the room, very small beds."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",3.0,"Though it‚Äôs called Dream, I did not dream here. My room had terrible sound insulation. Every door open and close on the floor was loud enough to wake - conversations carried through doors.

Notably -there  was also a loud periodic banging sound throughout multiple nights, not driven by guests. It‚Äôs in the walls or from the street.

I wore earplugs, but the bed physically shook every time a vehicle went by or the loud mysterious banging sound returned. I live in a city and am used to road noise, but this was something else. I was on floor 2.

The location  is great, but sleep and comfort are the biggest priority, esp with high rates and bookings driven by GOOG NYC.

The cleaning staff did an amazing job - I didn‚Äôt know my room would be tidied, but it was done thoughtfully ‚ù§Ô∏è

Decor feels like what used to be a cool boutique  hotel with tacky un-thoughtful modifications, like cold white fluorescent lights and worn furnishings. It really feels like wasted potential. If the designers at the Standard had this space - it would really be something special. It felt like someone bought what used to be a great space and tacked on poorly thought out, cold design elements. The TEMU white fluorescent lights must‚Äôve really got to me. üòÇ"

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",2.0,"Lots of really weird smells and really ambivalent staff. If you're looking for staff at a bar or pool who doesn't care if you live or die, this is the place for you! Lobby was loud but not particularly fun. Room was fine; can't expect something huge in a hotel in Chelsea. Nice location though."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"I was so excited to stay at this hotel, and it was a huge disappointment! The room was so Small!! The sink doesn‚Äôt drain! The shower in my room had very low pressure, everything was just so weird! Now, the biggest problem is the pool area. The poolside cisterns are paid separately; you have to reserve them to use them. This makes absolutely no sense if you're already staying at the hotel and paying a resort fee. It should have been included in this extra fee. It's absurd! The hotel staff working at the front desk are very polite, but in the evening, when the staff responsible for allowing access to the rooftop bar arrives, they are all arrogant! I asked a simple question about how access works, and one of the staff members called me out for being in the wrong place, even though the barriers were all open. They laughed at me right afterward! Hyatt standards don't apply to this hotel! I work at a Hyatt hotel, and I found this guest service absurd! Terrible. I don't recommend it."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",3.0,"This hotel really is a mixed bag.  Some things are excellent, others are quite poor.  In summary, it is very much form over function.  We loved the aesthetic, port holes, cocktail bar, art work etc but we had practicality issues, e.g. insufficient storage space in the rooms.  We had to move rooms due to the noise of the air conditioning in the first room which had a lovely view of the Empire State.  We were moved without quibble but lost the great view.  Used the gym several times which is well equipped but a bit cramped.  Had to go out for breakfast, there is a cafe as part t of the hotel but limited choice.  Wasn‚Äôt an option for us as they did not do decaf coffee.  The worse aspect of the hotel is the use of pool.  I spent a lot of time researching a hotel in Manhattan with a pool but hotel guests can only use it up to 10:30 am for free, after that it is open to the public by reservation who pay up to $120 a sunbed.  Feel a bit conned by this, completely hidden charges, which had I known about would probably have booked elsewhere."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"Only negative is the nightclub on the top floor‚Ä¶ be sure to be on a low floor. It is booming until 4:00am!!  However the staff were great.  Cam and Amit at the pool are the best!!  Courteous and very helpful, very professional and accommodating"

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"Hotel pool unavailable to hotel guests. Day pass guests have more access than the paying hotel guests. One big $$$ grab.

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",2.0,"I arrived at Hyatt at 4:40 pm
My room and the room of my colleague we're not ready.
At the reception, asking politely for an explanation, we have been treated very poorly by the attendants (more than one), that didn't even bother to give us an explanation.
We waited, waited more, asked again (same treatment).. room was finally ready for check in only at 10:00pm. Unbelievable

The more, we didn't receive even an apology.

Breakfast was the most basi (just coffee and 4 different types of pastry every day, that's it), and served by untrained, impolite staff."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,I've recently stayed at one of the pool access suites. I had a wonderful experience which was almost ruined when a group of pool day pass guest stole my birthday crown. Thanks to May she helped us recover the crown and made sure my experience stayed awesome! I would definitely return.
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"Thank you so much, May, for being our umbrella when we needed it most. Your warmth and generosity made my time here truly special ‚Äî I had such a wonderful experience thanks to your incredible hospitality."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"Easily one of the worst hotel stays and experiences I have ever had at a Hyatt property. Checked in at the check in time on the app, arrived at the hotel about an hour or so after check in time after traveling. Upon check in I was told my room was ready always a great thing to hear when arriving. Upon entering the room I was met with a horrible stench of marijuana and mildew in the room it was unbearable. I went back down to the front desk to see if they had another room available I was informed that they did not have any rooms and that the hotel was completely booked for the night (they were not and I was only there for one night). I asked if they could send someone to inspect where the smell could be coming from (it was coming from the vents). I also asked if they could send someone to possibly deodorize the room from the smell. Returning back to the room the smell had worsened at which point I went back to the desk because the issues had still not been addressed and I needed to get ready for dinner I was attending. I was told by the front desk to ‚Äúuse the shower in the gym‚Äù if I did not want to bear the smell in the room. Are you serious? I then contacted Hyatt to see if they could assist further with the issue since there was no manager around. Upon speaking with Hyatt they contacted the manager directly of the property to see if there was a way to fix the situation at which they said all they could offer was canceling my reservation and refunding or offering me a 50% discounted rate for the night. I was not looking for any compensation or upgrade like that though it was very kind of them to do. The reservation team at Hyatt also discovered that the hotel did in fact have 9 of the same rooms available for booking at that moment (it was already 7pm) and for me to go to the front desk and inform them of this. Upon returning to the desk now a 3rd time the same employee that told me to use the gym shower said the manager is aware of the situation and there‚Äôs nothing they can do. I then asked to speak with this said manager. When she arrived she finally admitted they have a room available but it will take an hour for it to be cleaned because housekeeping was behind and they would call me. Fine. I waited the hour and a half for the new room no call. I returned to the desk a 4th time to see if the new room only for them to give me the same keys to the smelly room I was currently in. The manager came back to finally give me the keys to a new room. Fast forward to check out I was provided with a bill for the full amount paid and not the 50% discount promised by the manager and Hyatt. The location of this place is great but the staff is lacking as well as the overall cleanliness of the property. I will not be staying again."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,Jess is the best. If I was drowning I would want her. To. Save me. 2 years later and I'm still in love. She's the best.
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,Awful experience!
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",4.0,"The rooms look tired and the carpets are starting to smell bad. If these issues were fixed, the hotel would be great. The rooms have a modern and stylish design. Jay at the front desk provided us a great service."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"Dream Downtown ‚Äì A Rooftop View Worth the Hype
I stayed at Dream Downtown four days ago, and honestly, it was a vibe! The rooftop view alone is enough to make you fall in love with the place‚Äîpanoramic skyline views, vibrant energy, and a relaxing yet stylish atmosphere.

The rooms were clean and comfortable, but the real highlight was the rooftop. Whether you‚Äôre chilling with friends or just enjoying the view solo, it‚Äôs an experience worth having.

I highly recommend it if you‚Äôre looking for a hotel in NYC that blends nightlife, scenery, and comfort in one place.

Where should I film next for you?

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,Service of Jay was amazing. Helped me to get a taxi cheaper with a fast timing. Much appreciated it
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",4.0,"Good value and great location.  There is a nice upscale restaurant in the basement and a separate club operating on the top floor.  The pool is in the center of the building just above the atrium/lobby.  The rooms are spacious enough and have some amenities but the fridge is filled with mini bar items.  Our room was on the 2nd floor which looked out directly to the pool deck.  Overall it was a nice stay.  The subway is at the end of the block (A,C,D,E) and Chelsea Market is a block away.  Location is everything and this was a good value for our trip."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"We absolutely loved our stay at Dream Downtown. We were there with our 4-year-old daughter and couldn‚Äôt have received a warmer welcome. Paul, the hotel manager, gave her some stickers, and she talked about him throughout the entire trip. Anthony found us a great room to accommodate a rollaway bed. Janete and the entire staff were so kind. One of our bags was lost by the airline when we arrived, and they made a point of personally delivering it as soon as it arrived. They even provided extra amenities to compensate for the days we were without our bag due to the airline. Perfect service and a perfect stay!"
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"Very nice and unusual place. At first sight it looks like a night club. It fits if you come to celebrate something or rest with friends. It has great service,  rooms have unusual design, but they are very comfortable"

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,Jay was great
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,Great location and sizable rooms for NYC. Loved the fun 2000s modern touches in the rooms and art in the lobby - it‚Äôs a very fun design experience
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,"AMITT and MAY are so great, kind, friendly, and incredible workers. Ask for them at the pool!!

Jay and Seth are so on top of it! They made our entire group feel so loved, they took such good care of us. Thank you x 1000, we had the best time at this Hyatt location."
"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",5.0,Hotel was modern and lively. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff was attentive and very helpful. Jay helped us get a ride to the airport that was more cost effective than ride share based on the current rate at the time. 10/10 would return.

If you are looking for a good hotel with great location preference then this is the one! If you want bigger rooms with better service and better hotel facilities then this is not for you. The hotel does have a really good pool but it‚Äôs not kids friendly"

"Dream Downtown, by Hyatt",1.0,"FEELS LIKE YOUR BED IN ON THE CURB!! Never stay here if you want to get any sleep. While room are comfortable the noise level is like you are in the middle of the street. Traffic , honking cars every 10 seconds, people screaming. Windows are so bad you can hear people just talking. ALL NIGHT NON-STOP."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,4.0,"The hotel was okay‚Äîyou get what you pay for. The elevators were extremely slow and inefficient. The 5-star rating is solely for the front desk employee, Vanetta/Venetta, who was kind, polite, and helpful even during a busy checkout time. We had expected a decently sized room, but it was quite compact despite having a king bed."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,5.0,<NA>
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,2.0,"Small room, even by NYC standards and there was a loud banging sound, I think water hammer, as loud as slamming your own door."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"I have never stayed at a worse hotel in my life and I travel very often. I called before hand to confirm certain amenities, I was told they did have things they did not. I arrived with 3 tired children at night time to find out the restaurant is closed. I just called 30 minutes prior to confirm it was open before I booked the reservation. Then upon my arrival the elevator‚Äôs either didn‚Äôt work or they only had one operating and myself and my 3 kids u set 5 had to take the stairs. It was the tiniest most cramped unclean room I have ever seen in a hospitality setting. We left the minute we entered the hotel room. The awful company refuses to issue me a refund for the 30 minute reservation and one minute spent in their room. I have contacted them several times about my concern and I would recommend anyone to stay far away. Spend a little more on a fancier hotel the customer service and experience is well worth the money. Hilton clearly does not care about their customers in any way as my complaints continue to go unanswered. I will continue to escalate my complaint and hope someone does they right thing and issues my refund as I was charged fraudulently. If I left your hotel or scheduled appointment due to misleading information on the services or amenities you provide and I did not use your facility then a full refund should be issued. I wasted time and my children did not eat until midnight due to the fiasco at their hotel."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,5.0,Great hidden away hotel very close to the stock exchange and Wall St... but also close to the Staten Island Ferry and other boat trips and subway stations to take u uptown so also great for tourists:-)))) XXXXX
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"Came in early for a concert and I understand that check in was at 4pm and we came prior just in case a room was available. (I already booked and paid for said room online) Our room was not available at the time which was no big deal as we were told we can leave our luggage and it will be safely guarded. We decided to leave our luggage with security and we just wanted to double check that we can grab our bags later since we would be checking in later in the night after a concert. Security staff mumbled and was openly pretty rude and not helpful. Made it seem like our bags would be unreachable after 7pm. We ended up missing our train and decided to check in to our room since at this point, it was after 4pm. Front desk was very helpful,professional, and informative. Unfortunately our room to our hotel room was jammed shut and would not open. We were told to call the front desk using a phone in the hallway to ask for assistance. Was informed that a mechanic would be showing up shortly. After waiting for almost 30+ minutes in the hallway by our room in the heat with all our luggage, had to call again just wondering when this would get fixed and we would be able to actually enter our room. Was now informed that they were completely unaware that we were waiting which is a bit strange since we went through the check in process, was given keys, and called prior about the malfunction with our door. Was eventually fixed after a long wait. Definitely not a $360 per night experience I would ever expect."

DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,4.0,"I really enjoyed our experience here. We had a room on the 14th floor with a king bed and everyone was so helpful and kind! My in laws were on the 36th floor with an awesome view! It was nice to see the view of the financial district.
The cookies are delish too! The only con was waiting for the elevators in the morning. If you are planning on leaving before 11am, you will probably wait up to 10 minutes. One morning I waited 15 before doing the stairs with my bags! Besides that, great service, location (right by the R and W, so that‚Äôs fun) and cold, nice room. The AC was so so nice in the summer."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"Lamentable el trato al hu√©sped, no devuelven el deposito. 50 usd por noche. Fueron 5 noches"
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,2.0,"Elevators were very slow, broken on a few occasions, and often overcrowded. I was late to work meetings and events constantly due to this. Also, I was disappointed to learn I had to order room service in order to use the breakfast benefit as a Gold Hilton member, which I didn‚Äôt have time for in the morning in part due to the challenge elevator situation. The WiFi was also very intermittent and inconsistent, often dropping for hours and rendering it worthless combined with the poor cell reception in the room. Overall a poor stay and will likely not return."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"I checked-out more than a week ago, on August 11th, and they still didn‚Äôt return my 213$ deposit. I tried contacting them a few days ago and nobody answered.
An absolute scam of a hotel."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,4.0,"Posizione nel centro di wall street vicino al battery park, al molo dello staten island ferry e al toro. Camera molto ampia con frigo, palestra h24 ed erogatori di acqua. Possibilit√† di lasciare i bagagli al check out inclusa gi√† nel prezzo."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,4.0,Comfortable NYC hotel in the financial district.  Location is within walking distance to a lot of attractions.
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,5.0,"I was a little hesitant at first because of some comments I‚Äôd read, but this turned out to be a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. The hotel is clean, spacious, and modern. I had a King City View room; the view was stunning, and I had no issues with the elevators (there are three).

What stood out was the location, it‚Äôs perfect! Close to major attractions, restaurants, and public transportation, yet still peaceful and quiet at night. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout my stay, especially Jose at the front desk. Shoutout to him for the amazing customer service! I‚Äôd honestly go back just for him.

Overall, I absolutely loved my time here and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area. I‚Äôm already looking forward to coming back!"
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"I was very disappointed with my stay due to the unprofessional attitude of several staff members. Their rudeness was enough to affect the mood of my trip, and it makes me question why they are working in hospitality. I have traveled extensively around the world and have never felt the need to leave a negative review until now. This is also not my first time visiting New York, but it was by far the most unpleasant experience I‚Äôve had with hotel service.

Both the reception staff and the luggage storage staff were unwelcoming. Not acknowledging greetings and responding with nothing but a curt ‚Äútime‚Äù is simply unacceptable in this industry. Guests deserve to feel respected, not dismissed or spoken to in such a way.

I sincerely hope management takes this feedback seriously and considers hiring staff who are better suited for customer service. Unfortunately, I would not choose to stay here again, and I would advise others to reconsider if they wish to start their day on a positive note."

DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"TERRIBLE HOTEL. Don‚Äôt come. Rude front desk, slow elevator, old & dirty & small room.

1) rude front desk
We asked for late check-out at 1:30pm.  A staff agreed the night before, and then on the day off they denied it and said ‚Äúno one has agreed‚Äù and had VERY BAD ATTUTUDES. That‚Äôs just ridiculous.

2) slow elevator
Lived on 40+ floors and every single-trip up or down takes 5 minutes. It literally stops every 5 floor‚Ä¶ Be prepared

3)
We used alcohol swipes to desensitize the table tops on day 1, and it came off BLACK‚Ä¶ The tables are STICKY, and the rooms overall very old. The room was also small and could only accommodate one check-in luggage laying flat opened up. The untidiness (and sticky everything) was a deal breaker.

DO NOT STAY HERE‚Ä¶ We booked a 7-day stay and checked out on day 2 (switched hotel).

Can‚Äôt believe this is a Hilton hotel. So badly run."

DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,5.0,"The location of the hotel is awesome, and the service is great! I would like to provide a special appreciation to the bellman Stalin, my phone was left at the front desk of the luggage storage room, and he helped me to keep it safe until I find out ü•∫"
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"This is definitely not a 4-star hotel. First of all, the rooms are worn out. There are thin connective doors that are purposefully left out from the photos of the rooms. You can hear any noise coming from the other room like walking, snoring or other people talking. The main door has the same issue, and the gap between the door and the wall even allows light from the hallway to get into the room.

On top of that, you only get two bottles of water on arrival, regardless of the duration of your stay. They ask for 3$ for any additional 0.5L bottle. Any decent hotel offers complimentary water every day."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,4.0,Great view to outside. Near to a subway station.
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,4.0,"I recently stayed at this hotel and overall had a pleasant experience. I‚Äôve rated the room 4 stars for a couple of reasons.

While the room was clean, well-maintained, and offered a comfortable stay, it did feel a bit compact for what‚Äôs considered a king room. Additionally, the elevator situation during peak hours was a bit challenging. With only three elevators servicing a 45-story building, wait times can get long‚Äîespecially in the mornings around 9‚Äì10 a.m., when staff are also using the lifts to access guest floors. It would be great if there were a dedicated service elevator to help streamline the experience for hotel guests.

The air conditioning was another area that could use improvement. It tends to cool the room quickly and then shuts off, which leads to noticeable fluctuations in temperature. A more centralized or consistently regulated system would really enhance comfort.

That said, the staff truly made the stay enjoyable. The reception team was welcoming and helpful throughout, and every staff member I interacted with greeted guests with a smile. Their professionalism and friendly demeanor made a positive impact and helped offset some of the minor inconveniences.

All in all, I would recommend this hotel for its service and location, with just a few tweaks that could make the experience even better.

DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"A very bad hotel, only two bottles of water were issued for a 3 night stay for two people in the middle of summer!!!! After drinking these two bottles of water, you have to spend 3 dollars to buy mineral water that costs less than 0.5 dollars... Can you believe that this is a Hilton hotel and it is a 4-star hotel! ÔºüAnd if you just experience ""dehydration"", then congratulations you are still lucky enough, because the hotel's elevator is extremely small, can only accommodate six people with suitcases, but all the residents in the 40-floors building rely entirely on the two ""mini elevators"" up and down to travel. Imagine how long you'd have to wait to get on a down elevator if you lived below the 20th floor... If you were in a hurry, you'd have to consider jumping off the building... If you managed to survive the dehydration and the long wait for the elevator, it didn't end there, as the hotel's check-in staff on the second floor had a very bad attitude, along with the staff who handled the check-in on the first floor. The check-in staff on the second floor and the check-in staff on the first floor have such a bad attitude that at one point you'll think they're your boss. All in all, this hotel is an extremely bad experience, and unless you have no choice but to find a place to hide while being chased by a killer on the street, it's highly not recommended to make yourself suffer during a joyful trip."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"Worst Hilton we ever been. First day the gentleman at the luggage storage was mean and rude, even yelled at us for no reason (maybe because we have 2 luggage per person took him extra effort) and the receptionist said we cannot get any water for free even the reservation was for four nights. Elevator was extremely slow and sometimes you got to wait more than 10 minutes. The location is the only pro for them. Do not book"

DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,1.0,"‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ The DoubleTree of Disappointment

I don‚Äôt even know where to begin with this circus of incompetence masquerading as a Hilton property. DoubleTree by Hilton? More like DoubleTrouble by Who-let-this-happen.

Let‚Äôs start with the basics: hydration. You‚Äôd think that in the sweltering New York summer heat, a Hilton-branded hotel would graciously provide guests with a humble bottle of water. Silly me. Not only was there *no* water in the room, but the lone water tank in the lobby was either empty, ‚Äúin the process‚Äù of being refilled (eternally), or available with a side of passive-aggressive commentary from the front desk if you dared to *actually fill a bottle*. Heaven forbid you expect hydration without humiliation.

Now let‚Äôs talk **toilet paper** ‚Äî or should I say translucent tissue of betrayal. I‚Äôve seen more durability in a fortune cookie slip. It was so thin, I gave myself an accidental self-exam. Hilton, if you‚Äôre trying to save money, maybe don‚Äôt start with your guests‚Äô dignity.

And then‚Ä¶ *the elevators.* Oh dear lord, the elevators. A masterclass in inefficiency. Picture this: a narrow, airless hallway where time stands still and humanity gathers in sweaty desperation for a chance to rise or descend. You‚Äôll wait 20‚Äì30 minutes only to squeeze into an overstuffed tin can, or more likely, watch it close in your face like a cruel joke. By the third day, I considered installing a pulley system or just rappelling down the building.

As for the **room** ‚Äî ‚Äúcozy‚Äù in the way a storage closet is cozy. The so-called ‚Äúking-size bed‚Äù was clearly designed for royalty from the land of Lilliput. My feet were dangling like a rejected marionette, and the mattress? One side bulged out like a herniated disc, giving me the nightly sensation of rolling into the abyss. It was less ""restful sleep"" and more ""existential spiral into Dante‚Äôs Inferno.""

All in all, this place is a comedy of errors ‚Äî minus the comedy. If you enjoy dehydration, elevator rage, DIY bathroom trauma, and sleeping on a mattress shaped like a ski slope, then hey, this is your dream destination. Otherwise, do yourself a massive favor and *stay literally anywhere else.*

Hilton, you owe me a bottle of water, a functioning elevator, and a mattress that doesn‚Äôt double as a death trap."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,3.0,"Great location, the air conditioning sounded like an airplane motor about to take off up in the air."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,2.0,"Went in to reception to collect something that my elderly father had left behind in his room. I was met by the rudest receptionist who didn‚Äôt even look at me and rudely threw the bag of his belongings at me. I am disappointed by this service, and just thought I‚Äôd share my experience"
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,4.0,Security box and coffee maker were not working üòû
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,3.0,"For the rate I got for this location at DoubleTree, my rating reflects what my stay was for four nights. I think with housekeeping, I assumed that when I am gone out for the day, the housekeeping would come in and clean my room but nope, that never happened. The only time they cleaned my room was when I had to tell the front desk attendants to phone the housekeeping people to clean my room. Even if my ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù sign was up, I would always remove it signifying that yes it‚Äôs okay to go to my room and clean it cause I am gone exploring by that time. When I was cleaning up to check out, I thought I saw an insect on my bed. I thought it was just lousy work from housekeeping. I was reasonably gone for a long time in NYC which gives the housekeeping people enough time to clean my room. I believe on the first full day, they knocked on my door but I was truly scared because the knock was so loud and I was alone. I wish they can go a different approach when the hotel guests are expecting housekeeping to come in because I was truly terrified of the loud knocking. I never checked out through the app so it was just a whole new experience for me where I accidentally checked out early, but I thought they would give me to 11:00 A to check out but when it was 8 A, an employee opened my door to see if I was still in the hotel room. I understand and I really do apologize for that but I wish they could‚Äôve knocked (they probably did but I didn‚Äôt hear). Overall, I can‚Äôt really complain. I was near several subway stations to where I can get by easily. This hotel is near the Ferry, World Trade Center, the Charging Bull. The feeling is neutral, I just wish the hotel could improve in those aspects. Oh and the hotel is dangerously slow, I so wish they would fix it or something because that is a big no no to accommodate elderly people, people on wheelchairs, disabilities. Yeah, :( just overall truly disappointed but I thank the hotel employees for showing up and working their hardest everyday. Thank yall. <3"

Very Disappointing ‚Äì More Like a Hostel Than a Hotel

This was one of the worst hotel experiences I‚Äôve had. The rooms are extremely small, outdated, and poorly maintained. There are only two elevators for the entire building, and it‚Äôs not unusual to wait 15‚Äì30 minutes just to get one‚Äîif you‚Äôre not forced to take the stairs, depending on which floor you‚Äôre on.

The hotel is severely understaffed, and it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get assistance or connect with someone when needed. Despite carrying the Hilton name, they are not truly part of Hilton. They seem to use the brand just to attract guests, but don‚Äôt honor the standards. Diamond status? Completely ignored.

Honestly, it feels more like a low-end hostel than a proper hotel. I would strongly recommend staying elsewhere."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,5.0,"This is my go-to hotel when I need to be downtown. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and efficient. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and average size for the city. They're consistent and have had good rates available when I booked, even with little notice at times. The 2nd floor lobby area has a well-stocked convenience store, a great sitting area, microwave, utensils, etc. The Italian restaurant on the first floor, Antica Ristorante, is a nice, somewhat upscale option. They also have good to-go options if you don't feel like having a formal meal. You can't go wrong with the pasta, and I love the Pasta e Fagioli con Salsiccia soup that comes with a delicious bread. Definitely recommend staying here."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,2.0,"Stayed at DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown ‚Äî the location is great, very convenient for exploring Lower Manhattan, and check-in was smooth. The warm cookie on arrival is always a nice Hilton touch.

However, the rooms felt a bit small and dated, and housekeeping could be more attentive. Also, elevators were often slow, especially during peak hours.

Overall, it was a decent stay, but for the price and Hilton name, I expected a bit more in terms of comfort and service."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,5.0,Great people
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,4.0,Elevator wait is longer than normal
DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown,5.0,Great hotel in an excellent location!  Clean and comfortabe room. I stayed in a King with River View on the 32rd floor for three nights in late June.  Awesome view. Very gracious staff and elevators were not a problem. Do not let other reviews prevent you from booking a room here. I will stay here again on my next visit to NYC.

Now there are 3 elevators so look to wait for at least 10 to 12 minutes to go to the ground floor. The staff is very friendly. The bathroom is very small and the room in my opinion only is small, compared to other places where i stayed. also the should have a built in mini fridge because that sliding draw cooler doesn't keep anyhing cold."

Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,5.0,Clean rooms and amazing staff all round.  Very helpful for all your needs!
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,5.0,I came to NY to celebrate my bday with my partner. I requested a room with accessible accommodations and was very pleased. The staff was very friendly. I requested a extra chair and a staff member brought it to our room in minutes. The room and bathroom was very clean and bed was comfortable. Breakfast was good they had a wide variety every morning. Check in and check out went good. The location was perfect. I was very pleased with my stay here and will definitely book this hotel again. The only thing that's missing is a sitting area in the lobby that you can watch TV and enjoy a coffee! üòä
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,3.0,"Location is perfect.  Right off the highway and surprisingly not so noisy at night.  Would stay there again for sure.  They have parking on premises but I missed the memo that's it's $40/night.  I thought it was free/included in the stay.  It's not.  Good shower, pillows were great, comfy.  A quick visit made simple"

Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,5.0,"Very nice stay. Rooms are a little bit small, and the refrigerator is as well. Still a 5 star rating. The rooms are new and clean. We enjoyed the free breakfast! There was a lovely assortment of food. I thought the cheese omelet was good. For a free buffet, we were impressed. The staff and valet parking attendants couldn't have been nicer!"
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,"Miserable Experience ‚Äì Spent the Night in My Car
I‚Äôm a Silver Elite member with Marriott, and if I could give this Fairfield Inn in Queens a zero or negative rating, I absolutely would. My experience on the first night was not just disappointing, it was outright unacceptable, showing a complete disregard for guest comfort, service standards, and basic hospitality.
After a 6+ hour drive, I arrived around 10:00 PM, exhausted and just looking forward to a good night‚Äôs sleep. Instead, I walked into a room that was unbearably hot. The air conditioning was completely non-functional. I spent 30 minutes trying every setting and switch‚Äînothing worked.
Between 11:00 and 11:30 PM, I called the front desk multiple times asking for help. He couldn‚Äôt figure out. Finally, I went down in person and stood at the unattended desk for over 15 minutes. Someone eventually showed up around 11:45 PM‚Äîand informed me that there was nothing they could do. No other rooms. No fix. And the ‚Äúengineer‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be available until 1:00 AM because he ‚Äúhas two jobs.‚Äù I wish I were joking.

In a last-ditch effort, I opened the windows, only to be hit with the noise of traffic as if I were sleeping on the sidewalk. With no help from the hotel, no functioning AC, and no possibility of rest, I grabbed my essentials and slept in my car. That‚Äôs right, I paid for a Marriott/ Fairfield hotel room and ended up spending the night in my vehicle.

This is not what I expect from any hotel, let alone one under the Marriott brand. Despite the hotel‚Äôs convenient location for me, I will not stay here again."
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,"The phone receptionist on June 1st around 4:51 PM was extremely rude and disrespectful. If you don't like your job, quit. The management team needs to give whoever works during that time frame customer service training."
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,2.0,"I'll start by saying the front desk staff was exceptionally friendly and welcoming.  They will be the best part of my review...

The rooms are ridiculously small! They are half the size of the regular rooms! The mattresses are what I can only imagine as the equivalent of prison mattresses.

With mandatory valet, you'd assume that the valet staff would be more attentive. I called for my car and SEVERAL minutes later still no car! My Uber got here before my car did.

The breakfast taste like it came from a can. Please save your taste buds and DO NOT TRY THE CHEESE OMELET (unless you're traveling with your worst enemy; then by all means!)

I'm going to chalk up my experience to the fact that this is a quick pit stop type of hotel. We have decided to cut our trip 2 days short and go home."
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,4.0,Very small rooms that were setup very well. The valet parking was a must which kind of stinks but it‚Äôs New York.
Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,4.0,"We went here for one night in 2024. It was an almost perfect stay. First off, it is a rather quiet hotel, which was nice. The lobby was modern and comfortable. The rooms were pretty big and clean, which was good. We didn't need any service, but the things provided were appreciated. However, the location is pretty bad, as it is right next to a highway, and even with 3 sound machines blaring, you can still hear the trucks. Overall, a great stay, but the location was mediocre."

Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,"Worst experience ever. I asked if I could check in at 6:00 am and I was told yes that would be fine. At 10:00am someone knock on the door. I was in the shower trying to get out to get the door and I open the bathroom door a staff member opens our room door. I asked how can I help you and she said you need to leave it‚Äôs check out time. I told her I was told by a staff member I could do an early check in and she said now it‚Äôs time to check out. I paid $250 for a room for only 4 hrs. The staff was super rude, not accommodating. And their excuse was because everyone‚Äôs shift change. They can‚Äôt verify if that person did an early check in time. I don‚Äôt understand who stays at a hotel for only four hours after I was specifically told by a staff member that I would be able to do an early check-in. Worst hotel experience ever."

Rice & Beans Restaurant,2.0,The food is good you can‚Äôt take that away from them but the customer service is non existent. The servers are the nastiest people I‚Äôve ever met which is a shame because the owner is a nice guy. It‚Äôs not even worth complaining to the owner about because one of the servers is his daughter. Nothing will be done. Also the catering prices are a bit ridiculous. If you want good food with condescending attitudes and the occasional eye roll look no further.

Rice & Beans Restaurant,4.0,"This place is a hidden gem! Sometimes it‚Äôs a hit or a miss with flavor but overall the food is usually tasty. The only reason why I didn‚Äôt give the full 5 starts is because over the years they got stingy with how much food they put in the trays. The family meal has definitely decreased in size of the rice and beans . They used to pack the rice until the plastic cover can‚Äôt close properly but now, I barely have enough for me and my 3 year old to share."

Comfort Inn JFK Airport,1.0,"I arrived the night of the 31st and waited for the shuttle at Federal Circle. After waiting 20 minutes I called the Front Desk and she told me no shuttles after 11 and gives me an attitude after taking an Uber. I arrived in confederate on it and questioned why only till 11 and she continued to give me an attitude we went back-and-forth for a while told me she told me if I don‚Äôt like it I could stay somewhere else. She absolutely had a. I hate my job attitude. So I sucked it up and went to my room. Walls were thin, the room smelled musty and It was very noisy from the outside. Also the vent from the air conditioning was leaking. I pretty much couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. The next morning I asked to see a manager to complain about the front desk attendant and I was told there was not available until 10 am . Really???? Then when I took the shuttle, I told him I want to get off at Federal Circle he takes me terminal 7. I decided to get off with the air train and it gives me an attitude. I‚Äôll never stay at this place again just do the attitude of the staff!"
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,5.0,Very convenient for anyone needing to stay close to JFK. (About 40 min to Time Square) Ms. Sandy has amazing hospitality and is so sweet! Truly a gem at what she does. The other stay was friendly as well. The room was clean and had all necessities for my short stay. The bed and pillows are comfortable. There arent dining options around but there is UBER EATS and two other restaurants that will deliver here in a timely manner. Will stay every time I fly through JFK. The shuttle bus and the hotel staffs great communication made things easy as well.
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,1.0,"I booked this hotel for July 25, 2025, expecting a safe and convenient stay after a long international flight with my infant. Unfortunately, the shuttle service stopped at 10:45‚ÄØPM, which was not clearly disclosed at booking.

Comfort Inn JFK Airport,3.0,"When you need a bed before or after your flight, but don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune. They don‚Äôt have a shuttle late at night, so we had to book other transport from the airport. Would have been nice to know that before you stand at the airport."
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,2.0,"I am writing an unfortunate review. I arrived at the Comfort Inn Tuesday night the 22nd at 11pm with a 2 year old and a 5 year old. Very tired! We had just been traveling from Norway for many hours. Upon our check in, I realized I had booked the wrong nights due to the European time change. It was an honest mistake. However, the management team still made me pay for an additional room at full price. I was very disappointed. The hotel still got my money for the night before, we were only staying one night they were not fully booked or sold out. So they unwillingness for them to put me in a room, or apply customer service for a mother traveling with 2 young children just shows that compassion and understanding go second to a buck. Our shower also leaked all over the floor, and the view of construction was not pleasant. Decent complementary breakfast."

Comfort Inn JFK Airport,1.0,"Terrible Customer Service ‚Äì Avoid This Hotel if You Can

I had one of the worst experiences at Comfort Inn & Suites JFK Airport, and I feel compelled to warn others. After a grueling 14-hour flight, I waited at Federal Circle for over an hour for the hotel shuttle that never showed up. I called the hotel twice and first a guy said shuttle will arrive in 5-10 minutes, i called back again after 40 mins of waiting and lady  said they just pass there but I was standing right there and no shuttle ever came. I‚Äôm not blind ‚Äî I know what I saw.

To make things worse, my sister was already at the hotel lobby and saw the shuttle driver leave the hotel an hour before I even arrived. Clearly, the staff either didn‚Äôt communicate properly or simply didn‚Äôt care. When I confronted the front desk about it, Adriani ( who i talked to over the phone) the lady working there, tried to cover it up by saying she was on her break and had gone with the driver. Why would the front desk staff be riding along on the shuttle during her shift?

This kind of behavior is unprofessional, dishonest, and completely inconsiderate, especially to tired travelers. The staff here seriously lacks accountability and customer care. If you‚Äôre looking for reliability and basic respect, I strongly suggest choosing a different hotel near JFK."
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,5.0,"Great location for those flying in from JFK.. Check in was quick and easy. As a matter of fact, we arrived early and there was no rooms available.. They will put your luggage away, if you decide to leave, until check in time.. I can‚Äôt say enough about Meaghan and how nice she is!! Meaghan made sure we had everything we needed. Meaghan went above and beyond to make sure we was comfortable.. I‚Äôm a vegan, and she tried to think of some vegan restaurants that was close by.. You don‚Äôt find many like her..

the ONLY person at this hotel that deserves any appreciation is ONE lady who worked at the front desk on may 4th 2025 @5:45am- so shoutout to her! She was great and is probably saving this hotel. Shuttle was a disgrace; both pick up and drop off- told it runs every 20minutes‚Ä¶ we waited over an hour for pick up after our long flight (10hrs). We then had to sit in the lobby for AN HOUR because ‚Äúearly check in would cost $45 extra‚Äù, the lady who told us this couldn‚Äôt have been more unwelcoming and rude. We then were instructed to schedule our morning shuttle pick up which we did with the front desk and when the morning came we barely made our flight. The shuttle took over 1/2 an hour to get to the first terminal only to realize no one was needing to be dropped there (mind you this hotel is only 5 mins distance from airport). We ended up getting off at a random terminal and taking the airtrain to our correct terminal. We had to sprint through the airport to not miss our flight. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone."

Comfort Inn JFK Airport,1.0,"Avoid if you want any sleep. I don‚Äôt know why the hotel plays loud music with speakers outside the lobby, right by the rooms‚Äô windows, all day till night. I had to call every night to turn it down, 11pm, and 8pm. For average $258 per night, it‚Äôs not worth it."
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,1.0,"Too expensive and their only good point is proximity to the airport. No food and shops close by.

My main problem is the noise. It‚Äôs  near a busy road and room has thin walls. I can hear all the noises from cars and planes, kids crying from the other room, steps and talking people by the hall, even the opening and closing of their doors. If you want a peaceful sleep, find another hotel. If you‚Äôre not bothered by the noise, location is good.

Airport Shuttle runs from 5am to 11pm only.

Breakfast is from 6am to 9am only."
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,4.0,"No hay estacionamiento, despues todo es perfecto"
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,4.0,I knew there would be airport noise but I was on a floor with a group of noisy guests that I could hear in my room until 2am. The gracious manager came and spoke to us in the morning. This made all the differenceüôè
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,1.0,Not safe. Breakfast was terrible. Will not stay again.
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,4.0,"My go-to hotel when I fly into and out of the JFK airport. The room is always very clean, especially the bathroom. The shuttle service is hit or miss, depending on the time of day and how busy they are are. Other than the shuttle service, my only recommendation is to stop serving pork sausage during breakfast."
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,1.0,"Trotz vorausgeganener Bezahlung, Aufenthalt wurde nochmals √ºber Kreditkarte abgebucht, und bis jetzt kein Geld zur√ºckerhalten, weder ich noch Reiseb√ºro haben Antwort erhalten, sehr unseri√∂s!"
Comfort Inn JFK Airport,5.0,"This hotel is amazing !! I arrived from Switerland super tired . The free shuttle was waiting for me and when i arrived at the hotel the staff was so kind and friendly ! They accommodated my every need with smiles and kindness. The room was spacious and the bed so comfy !
All the staff from front desk, breakfast to the cleaners work with great seriousness and smiles . An over all fantastic experience to start my New york trip !! Thank you to all ü´∂üèæ"

Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Do not and I mean do not stay here.
You can find another place not to far.
The receptionist that I had her name Silva something like that.
She COULD CARE LESS , let me repeat that.
SHE COULD CARE LESS .
I will definently tell all my airline friends not to stay at the Quality Inn.
The guest that were checking out as I was sitting there , also mentioned never again.
I am writing this review and I haven't even gotten the key to my room.
It's already to late to find another place.
Ounce again dont stay here.
PS.
DID I MENTION THAT THE RECEPTIONIST COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS.

Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Shocking , very disappointing service. We paid for this hotel but realised that it had no under 21 allowed and this was for a family member who was only 20 . Two weeks out we called booking .com and explained we weren‚Äôt able to use the room and asked for it to be cancelled and our money refunded . No response to booking . Com who were happy to refund  us . No answer to numerous emails and calls to the hotel . Be very careful dealing with this hotel . Read their reviews closely before you book a room here .
Updated . I‚Äôve looked at their response. Continued phone calls to the hotel direct and they were unreasonable and even though they had over two weeks to find other guests for the room they just didn‚Äôt reply ."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"This was definitely my worse hotel stay I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôve stayed at Quality Inns in other areas, no issues. This one though, I purchased a ‚Äú2-Queen‚Äù room and walked into a small, musty, dusty popcorn ceiling, stained bedskirt, sticky hotel room floors with 2 full sized beds. I went to the front desk about it as my husband is over 6 feet tall and I specifically purchased a 2 bed Queen room so we would all have space. The front office lady said, ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs what we have for the 2 Queen beds‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think she knows that ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù isn‚Äôt just the name of the room‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the bed size. She shrugged it off like I should have known that this is what Quality inn offers for Queen rooms. The hotel is also in a dangerous area where there were police out the window and pretty sure we heard gun shots. Our hotel door raddled like it had been broken into and they attempted to fix it. The lock on the door was also very loose. Very dirty and run down. I am very disappointed with this stay and unfortunately it was too last minute to change the location."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,3.0,<NA>
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"The only good thing was it close to the airport. The driver didn't even hold the door for us to come in. No ice, room smelled of roach spray. Luckily we were in  and out. And the drivers for the shuttle were rude, didn't put luggage in shuttle going or coming. He didn't even hold the door opened while we struggle to get into there establishment."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,4.0,"A low budget hotel, odd layout, rooms were fine, the shuttle to/from JFK was NOT timely at all."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,Room was filthy. Sheets and towels seemed clean.  Shuttle bus only runs every hour. Value was not worth the cost.
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"I only gave this hotel 1 star because it would not allow me to give  no stars.  I booked this hotel for the location being 1.7 miles away from JFK.  I had asked for early check-in (1-2 hrs early) and was told I would have to contact them upon our arrival.  We arrived 1.5 hrs early and was told for early check-in, I would have to pay an extra $50.  We decided to wait.  When I booked, I was told free parking.  The lady behind the bullet proof glass charged me $25.  When we got the key to our room, the smell could have woken the dead unless it was actually a dead body buried in the walls.  The blood stain in the bathroom (turned out to be a rust-colored water stain) kept me from even wanting to use the bathroom.  We couldn't even imagine sleeping there with the noise, stains and most of all, SMELL.  We checked out by 12:30am.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL REGARDLESS OF CLOSE PROXIMITY TO JFK."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"The hotel was absolutely disgusting. The room we stayed in was on the first floor with the window out looking the pavement and parking lot. Even with blinds, you could see car lights all through the night, and the windows were not properly guarded by a fence, which made it a safety hazard for that area.

The room itself with humid when we walked in, with mold visible on the ceiling of the bathroom and on the walls in the main room. The fan in the bathroom didn‚Äôt even work so, you couldn‚Äôt ventilate it after taking a shower. The water was also not hot enough and made it unbearable to take a shower.

In addition, when we got in to check in, the staff was late so, we stood around after traveling for 7 hours and had to wait for someone to come in!

The only good thing was the bed, no bed bugs surprisingly!

Overall, this is not worth the price."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"The hotel is located on sketchy area. Carpets are so dirty and smelly, even with gum on them. Loud noise all night,  doors banging,  loud music, water on the shower was no draining, even a old soap from last customer on the shower. Stains on the walls, overall not a good experience, wouldn't come back."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,2.0,"Needed one night stay close to airport, expensive for what it is but  gets the job done, booked through Expedia, close to JFK, free shuttle to Federal Circle airport ram station, free breakfast consists of bread for toast, cold cereal, waffles if you're able to wait for the appliance,  coffee, juice. Burger King 400 feet away."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Me aloj√© en este hotel para volar temprano en el dia siguiente. Hice caso omiso a las rese√±as, y me di cuenta que eran ciertas.
Pese a que tuvimos una ""buena experiencia"" viendo las rese√±as sobre el hotel, pasamos miedo para llegar en transporte p√∫blico en este barrio. No pudimos dormir debido a que se oia todo y habia gente de fiesta en las habitaciones y conversando a viva voz bajo la ventana, la cual no aislaba nada, hasta las 4 de la ma√±ana que me fui de ese tuburio.
Si pueden evitarlo, no reserven aqui."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,5.0,"Super friendly and helpful staff, lady at the check in, very polite and helpful, room is nice and clean, breakfast not bad, enjoyed our stay before long flight."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,2.0,"At $185 a night this hotel is definitely not worth it. Shuttle just takes you to the air train stop, which doesn't really save any time or money and only runs hourly. The area didn't seem safe at all, with a thick security glass at the reception desk. There was also no key card required to use the elevators and the receptionist was definitely not checking people, so it didn't seem secure at all. Everything was run down, the hotel smelled awful, there was mold in the rooms, and no amenities (not even tissues in the room). The drain in the tub was clogged. Breakfast was extremely limited. The bed was at least pretty comfortable with clean linens and clean towels, but that's really the only upside.

I've honestly never stayed at a hotel this bad ever."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"J'ai r√©serv√© une chambre le 19 juin pour le 31 juillet je re√ßois confirmation avec un num√©ro de r√©servation. Arriv√©e sur place la r√©ceptionniste me dit avec un sourire narquois que ma r√©servation a √©t√© annul√©e

Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"WARNING! Do not stay here. This hotel is unsafe. There is no security. The lifts can be accessed by anyone as they do not require a room key. Given the area the hotel this is located in this is pure negligence!!!

If you want a quiet night and a clean room look elsewhere! The staff member working the night shift lets anyone in. We had multiple people in the room next door making noise from 12-4am. I considered contacting reception. However there was a phone with no information on how to contact reception.

We checked out we handed at 5am on July 29 the staff member did not say a single word. We placed our key on the pile of other keys and left as soon as possible. It was clear she had no interest i her role and ZERO customer service, doing her job  or interest in keeping non guests from the property. Absolutely disgusting experience.

I will be letting friends, family and anyone considering a trip to this neighbourhood NOT to stay here."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"I‚Äôve stayed in many hotels around the world, but this experience was by far the worst. Every single detail was more disappointing than the last. I chose this hotel because it‚Äôs near the airport and offers a free shuttle service. However, I was shocked when I called them from the arrivals terminal, and they told me I had to carry my luggage, walk to the metro station, and take a train to reach their shuttle pickup point! At that point, it would‚Äôve been easier (and worth it) to just take an Uber and pay for the ride myself.

The same issue happened on the return trip from the hotel to the airport. When I finally arrived at the hotel, the reception was behind a thick security glass, which made me feel like I was in a high-risk or unsafe area. Our room was literally in the basement, with very old furniture. Honestly, I‚Äôm still shaken by what I experienced‚Äîit was truly a terrible stay"
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,Te cancelan sin dar explicaciones. pienso que pague barata por una app y les conviene a ellos venderla m√°s cara a otras personas
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,2.0,This hotel is ok for a 1 night stopover but I wouldn‚Äôt stay longer than that.
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,3.0,Not very good motel and pretty small and even the TV has some bad stains on it and it's small and staff is slow I guess it's ok place to sleep and live
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,5.0,<NA>
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"I‚Äôm really sorry to share my experience at this hotel, as I had high hopes for my stay. This is my second time booking here, and my first visit didn‚Äôt start off well either. Just five minutes after checking in, I discovered that the wifi code wasn‚Äôt working. When I approached the front desk, the lady kindly tried to help but unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt work for her either, and I ended up without wifi for the entire stay.

Yesterday was my birthday, and I was looking forward to a relaxing time, but it ended up being quite disappointing. Upon arriving at my room, I noticed there was only one nightstand, which felt a bit off. I tried to turn on the TV, but when my friend arrived, I left the room and returned about five hours later to find the TV still off. I checked behind it and saw it wasn‚Äôt plugged in. After plugging it in, I could only access four sports channels and two news channels.

I went to the front desk for assistance, and while the woman there assured me someone would come, it took about twenty minutes. When the gentleman arrived, he seemed frustrated as he scanned through the channels, and when the screen remained black, he informed me that only three channels worked. I mentioned that I had been in the room earlier and didn‚Äôt experience any issues. Unfortunately, he responded with an attitude, and I didn‚Äôt want to argue, especially since it was already 1 am.

To top it off, this morning I tried to turn on a lamp, and it just slipped from my hand. I know that things can sometimes go wrong, but it‚Äôs disheartening when it happens during such an important occasion. I hope my feedback can lead to improvements for future guests."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,2.0,"Beware the shuttle is only on the hour, not continuous. The shower never really got hot, it was lukewarm at best. Breakfast selection was very minimal. No curtains in the room so wear an eye mask if you can only sleep in complete darkness."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,2.0,"Tr√®s moyen, passable pour passer 1 nuit avant de prendre l avion. Le personnel est cependant sympathique."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"This was by far the worst place I‚Äôve ever stayed at. The rooms are extremely worn down, and the windows don‚Äôt close properly, letting in constant noise from cars blasting loud music all night. The area feels extremely unsafe, and I felt uncomfortable the entire time I was there. If you value your safety and sleep, I would strongly recommend staying elsewhere."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"This hotel is a scam, do not book here!  If i could give Negative Stars I would do that.

I made a resevation for a layoff and informed the hotel that I would arrive around 1am.  When i got there they had given away my room and refused to give a refund.  I had to scramble to find lodging for the night.

I‚Äôve called several times and willing to show my phone bill that indicates I did call to tell them of late arrival."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Outside noise is horrible. Closed window seems to be open. You can put you finger in the gaps between .Cars racing and burning tyres all night until 4am. Beed linings were fresh but weed smelled everywhere. Airport transfer was the worst I ever experienced.
Hotel is only 5 min drive from airport but they make as wait 70 minutesüò°. Very unfriendly staff. I am glad we only stopped here for one night."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Avoid this place!!! We arrived and the first thing we smelled was Marijuana and cigarette smoke.  This is a no smoking hotel. Room was small for 4 adults on 2 full size?? beds. Breakfast was cold cereals, toast and Belgium waffles."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,5.0,"When it comes to lost and found, this place is trustworthy."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,3.0,Close to JFK. Free Shuttle. Scary neighborhood.  Lobby elevator does not work and apparently has not for a long time. Must take stairs to room. Not convenient with heavy luggage. Not a hot 7AM breakfast either unless you count the Belgium waffle maker which is slow and messy. Will not stay here again.
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"STAY AWAY!!!!!!

Reserved a room on April 9th (for my stay June 25th) for two queen beds. Got a confirmation email with the policy they would hold the room until 7:00am day of check out. My plane arrived at 11:00. I called to request the airport shuttle and was hung up on three times. On the fourth time, I was told there is no such thing as an airport shuttle and I need to take a taxi. I arrived and found out they gave away my room and only had a single bed room. I told them I had reserved the room three month ago and this was unacceptable and against their policy. I asked for a refund, they said no. I called other hotels and everywhere within walking distance was booked. I ended up having to stay the night and my family was crowded on the bed while I slept on the floor. When I went down in the morning to speak with the manager the same disrespectful desk agent was still there. She refused to give me her name, she refused to call a manager and when I called customer service, I found out she changed my reservation after I checked in, so it looked as though I booked a single. Luckily customer service had a record. I still have yet to get any resolution to this mess. DO NOT STAY HERE EVER!!!!!"
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Don‚Äôt come. The only positive thing is its location, which is not far from jfk.
The room is not clean, the bathtub water drains super slow, you can hear basically everything around you, and it‚Äôs super sketchy.
Parking is additional $25. And with all that negative, it‚Äôs not cheap at all!

STAY AWAY"
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Absolutely Horrible ‚Äì I Left Immediately. Do NOT Book.
I booked this hotel for two nights, but I left within 10 minutes of walking into the room. The property is extremely run down and located on a very questionable street. The parking lot is right next to a dumpster, and to get there, you have to walk through a filthy alley that reeks of urine.

The hallways were dirty, smelled of pot and cigarettes, and the room was dark with an overwhelming chemical smell. I did not feel safe at all.

I read the reviews before booking and really wish I had listened. Please learn from my mistake ‚Äî this place is NOT worth it.

When I asked for a refund, the manager refused. I was told that simply checking in meant I had ‚Äúagreed‚Äù to the room ‚Äî even though I was gone in 10 minutes. They still charged me $35 for early check-in (I arrived at 1:30pm; check-in is at 3). By the way there is $25 per day for parking, which was never clearly disclosed when I booked.

Please don‚Äôt bother responding to this review ‚Äî it‚Äôs clear the manager had no interest in making things right. Instead of crafting a reply, the right thing would‚Äôve been to refund at least the second night and waive the early check-in fee since I left right away.

Avoid this place at all costs."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Das einzige gute an dem Hotel, vom Airport aus gibt es ein Shuttlebus.F√ºr 1 Nacht ertr√§glich dieser L√§rm der Stra√üe trotz geschlossenen Fenster.Die Klima kann in der Nacht nicht laufen das das Bett genau daneben steht.Im Zimmer waren noch frische Malerflecken auf den M√∂beln,genau so wie im Flur.Das Fr√ºhst√ºck inkl. au√üer Waffeln ,das Ger√§t war extra aus geschaltet und es standen keine So√üen oder Honig daf√ºr da.Es gab Toast Butter Marmelade.

Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,We stayed two days and it was very disappointing. The room was dirty and the hallways too. The breakfast was never on time and poor. It was very noisy.

Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Had to stay here because of missed connection at JFK and let me tell you, it was awful. I never leave reviews, like ever, but had to for this place. Worst hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"It's terrible. I made the reservation, paid for it, and didn't get to stay there because they didn't receive my already paid reservation, and the receptionist started sleeping instead of trying to solve this issue and I wasn't the only one who didn't get to stay there. Some of the people who got to stay there told me that the rooms were trash and that there was no working Wi-Fi."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"I created 2 reservations, upon check in I opted to pay with a different card from the one I initially booked with for the second room, the male agent at the front desk said he will cancel my reservation and he doesn‚Äôt have a room for me, after going back and forth, giving him my card, he then threw it at me and said he cannot charge it, they then proceeded to charge my card 6 times, after which they charged my card for parking which I wasn‚Äôt parking on the property. Both male and female front desk agents were utmost unprofessional. Worst experience possible. Manager needs to do something about this."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Room smelled like cat pee. Although it‚Äôs close to the airport, I will never stay here again. It was only for 1 night and I checked in around midnight, not much I could do to change ."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,2.0,The hotel is run down and the hallways are dirty. The man who brought me to my room kicked the door to open it-didn‚Äôt use a key. There were no wall switches for the bedside lamps. One switch on the lamp was missing. The outlets were under the nightstand. The AC worked but the window didn‚Äôt keep out any street noise. There is an airport shuttle but it only runs on the hour. The 5 AM shuttle was full and it had to make another trip. The room seemed clean but it was too dark to really see. I would not stay here again.
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,3.0,Hotel ideal para cuando necesita hacer check in en cualquier horario. Llegamos a las 2:30 am y nos recibieron sin problema. Cercano al JFK. Hotel b√°sico. Para pasar una noche es ideal. Hab√≠a olor a humedad. Eso nos molest√≥. Pero despu√©s todo bien. El ba√±o impecable.
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,4.0,"Well it‚Äôs Quality Inn that is very close to JFK and the major routes.
The room is neat and clean. That‚Äôs enough for me to catch the flight next morning.
A bit noisy since it‚Äôs right next to the traffic.
The shuttle service starts at 5am. One shuttle every hour."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,3.0,"Their website says they have parking, but when we checked in we were charged $25 for overnight parking ($25 per day).  The room was clean and comfortable."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,3.0,"The shuttle service to Federal Circle at JFK  deserves a grade of  FF. Whilst other hotel shuttles came at least twice within an hour sometimes even more, Quality's van arrived on the half hour sometimes. The van leaves the hotel on the hour. Calling the hotel for answers on the van's arrival status was a waste of time. Vague answers or calls cut off.
The staff at the front desk were not friendly on either check in or check out.  One bathroom on  the 3rd floor  had a old toilet seat revealing the paint peeling off showing the wood toilet seat. Wood retains germs. There was presence of dry blood on the bathroom wall facing the toilet paper.
The location is good as there are various eateries and a wine store. Overall as I stayed twice within a week for next day connecting flights, I would not make the Quality Inn JFK my any choice in the future . Heed my words."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,Shuttle service to and from airport was a nightmare and not as promised. People behind desk were mean to everyone and hard to hear because of protection glass. I don't recommend this place.
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"DO NOT COME HERE! This is the WORST hotel experience I‚Äôve ever had. I booked for one night and found someone else‚Äôs hair all over the bed ‚Äî absolutely disgusting. I immediately went to the front desk, and the staff told me someone would be up to clean it in 10 minutes. We waited over 30 minutes, and no one showed up. When we went down again, there was no one around who could take responsibility for the situation. The front desk person casually said the manager couldn‚Äôt be contacted and just handed us an email address ‚Äî what kind of service is that?!

This hotel clearly doesn‚Äôt care about hygiene, customer service, or basic decency. I‚Äôm beyond frustrated and deeply disappointed. Save yourself the stress ‚Äî do NOT stay here."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"The first day I stayed here the housekeeping busted in my room and seen my daughter half naked. I asked the front desk to give me a room that feels more secure because the one they gave me didn‚Äôt lock. Than they gave me a room with a cracked mirror and no refrigerator. I asked the front them to give me a room with a refrigerator because we are going to be here for 4 days. She told me no. Than o told her to call her manager. He told her to put a refrigerator in my room‚Ä¶ Breakfast at this place is off brand toast, croissants or waffles. All carbs no meats or fruits of any kind. And if that 1 bottle of syrup runs off they said we don‚Äôt refill, one it‚Äôs gone it‚Äôs gone. Water pressure in my shower was horrible. I told the girl at the front desk about how my card key keeps deactivating when I leave for more that just an hour, she told me that‚Äôs not her problem. I said but you work here‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt waste your money. They also take pictures of the best corners of the hotel but once you get here you feel deceived. I asked to use the printer so I can print some paper work for my cruise I‚Äôll be on tomorrow. They told me I couldn‚Äôt use it."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,2.0,"Pictures online are misleading. The rooms may once have looked that way, perhaps a good 5 years ago.

Beds had a few too many nights slept on although the sheets were clean

I walked in shoes the entire stay as the carpets had last been cleaned 10 years ago or so it seemed.

Bathroom celing was patched up and in a shoddy moldy condion

Door safety latch was hanging on with 1 screw

The list could go on, bottom line is the budget for any upliftment or maintenence is clearly kept to a bare minimum. Thiis is such a pity as there is so much potential with the close vacinity to the airport."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,5.0,Best Hotel I¬¥ve been
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,2.0,"Airport shuttle is not taking you to the terminal, it takes you to the airport train and they could not even pick us up because it was not enough room for our luggage. They picked up only 2 families that had a lot of bags and the van did not have much room for luggage. The breakfast was poor, only waffles you had to make, cereal with milk and some bread, butter, jelly, no hot breakfast, no muffins, fruits etc. Also customer service is poor, I called front deal 10 times about an issue and they were hanging up and not answering the phone. When I asked the driver where we were supposed to put our luggage he was not answering until I asked 3 times. When I asked if they are bringing more items for breakfast they said they will in a minute and never did, just ignoring customers. I guess there is poor management. The elevator was not working and had to carry all my 4 luggages upstairs to the exit at check out myself. Also no facial tissue in the bathroom and AC was loud, a wall unit that I had to unplug because it wouldn‚Äôt stop when I turned it off. Will never book this hotel again."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"There was poop on the floor

This hotel had comfortable beds, but when we were walking to our room there was poop on the floor, and the hotel smelled like smoke. The breakfast was ok, but there was not much choices, just waffles, cereal, and bread. Rooms were very cold when we walked in, and there were suspicious noises outside the hotel."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"This is an ABSOLUTE DUMP! The rooms are in horrendous condition, especially the bathroom, see pictures below, and the hotel is completely run down with cheap patch up fixes throughout the hotel. The corridors smell of Indian food and we heard guests frying food in their rooms when walking by. The vending machine also did not work properly and only accepted $1 bills, not the $5 bills written on the machind. The area feels very unsafe and we couldn‚Äôt wait to leave in the morning! The only pros are proximity to the airport and friendly staff. Highly recommend staying elsewhere."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"I had a really disappointing experience. The receptionist wasn‚Äôt honest about the shuttle‚ÄîI waited for 20 minutes, and when I called back, she said she couldn‚Äôt send another one because it was already midnight. I didn‚Äôt like the way she spoke to me when I was trying to understand her. She made me feel stupid.

Also, the hotel said breakfast was included, but it was just bread, butter, and a few drinks‚Äînot a real breakfast like I expected."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,Front night clerk was so disrespectful and rude I call the night before to get a ride to the airport she gave me wrong information and when I I voice my opinion she started to record me on her phone tell me am disturbing her and she going to call the police on me and when I told her that am going to report her she told me she worked here for 2 years and she can‚Äôt loss her job very rude and tell me am going . This happened on may 11 2025
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,The shuttle was fast to get to us once we arrived and the staff was friendly. The room was supposed to be a two queen size bed but we ended up having a king size bed for three people and they weren‚Äôt able to change it‚Ä¶ The room door wasn‚Äôt closing properly. The room itself wasn‚Äôt super clean. The lock on the door wasn‚Äôt working. Would recommend as a last resort.
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"This place is a dump. Pictures do not reflect its reality. Front desk staff is rude and on their personal phone or doesn‚Äôt even look up to talk to you. Neighborhood is sketchy and loud.  You‚Äôll hear lots of noise inside the hotel too. Doors slamming, people talking loud/screaming. No iron in the room. Sticky hangers. Shame on Quality Inn for letting these people run this hotel. The replies they post after guests reviews are a bunch of fake crap. They don‚Äôt do anything to make it better. Save yourself and do not stay here. Let them go out of business."

Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL... We booked to stay here through hotels.com. When we arrived late at night with our 2 small children we were told our room would have no lock on the door. We accepted as it was the only room available after a long flight. When we went to our room it was already occupied with someone's luggage and the beds had been slept in. We went back to reception and were told there were no other rooms and we would have to stay somewhere else. The hotel refused to provide a refund. The staff and management are very unhelpful and rude. Disgusting experience and customer service. DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL, pay a bit more money and stay at a proper hotel."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,"Very disappointing stay :
Reception staff ( specifically the lady name Srehma receptionist ) was rude and unhelpful. We arrived at 2:30 PM and were told to come back at 3 PM, but still had to wait until 3:20 PM to get the room. I booked a room with 2 queen beds but got 2 double beds instead, and the receptionist claimed all rooms are the same size‚Äîclearly misleading. She also didn‚Äôt mention anything about a parking pass. On top of that, it‚Äôs been over a week and I still haven‚Äôt received my $100 deposit refund. Would not recommend this hotel."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,3.0,"Service was not bad, the front desk lady was helpful. Rooms were very noisy, you could hear each individual voice in the room right next to yours, also it is very hard to sleep when peoples car alarms keep going off next to yours window. Rooms were pretty clean overall, not the cleanest but not terrible either!"
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,3.0,Price was good. But noisy and shuttle left 10minutes late. If you want to get a great night's rest before a flight i'd look elsewhere
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,5.0,I went there once the staff was so nice room was perfect and girl on reception sam was so nice because i just ask for a favor she was very generous so give them 5 stars appreciate for that kind of fabulous service
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,4.0,"The hotel is great for an one-night stay with not very expensive price.
They provide a mini van from/to the federal circle station, where you could take the air train to terminals. We called upon arrival to book the service. It would be good if they had an email or WhatsApp for this as the phone reception is not always great at the airport.
The room is clean and can get access to hot/cold drinking water from the canteen. The heating is quite powerful which is great.

One flaw is that the mattresses of the two beds are inconsistent - one is quite hard and the other one is soft... Not sure why.
In addition, the breakfast is very basic, pretty much just hot/cold drinks plus toast&cereal."
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,5.0,Sadia is friendly & helpful. Shuttle bus service is quick . Room I got was super clean overall nice experience close to Airport . Thank you Quality will be back again
Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,1.0,Don‚Äôt stay here. Cockroaches coming in through the ceiling and they have the walls taped to stop them. Came back to the room and saw 5 of them trapped in the tape and immediately got a refund.

Quality Inn JFK Airport Rockaway Blvd,2.0,Getting a 2 only because the girl at the window was so kind. Entire hotel smells of smoke and I mean the moment the door opens. They have signs all over about a fine for smoking so clearly they are aware. I‚Äôm very allergic and asked for my money back and I was only in the room for five minutes. Refused to give me any $ back. It‚Äôs cheap and I made that mistake because I oy had a few hours before my flight and wanted to sleep but never again. Any high reviews are likely fake.
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,4.0,"Clean lobby, clean rooms, comfortable beds, good water pressure in shower. A/C worked fine and wasn't loud. The toilet in our room ran frequently; that was a little annoying, but we closed the bathroom door to muffle the sound.

Very close to JFK airport. The shuttle runs every half hour. It would be nice if it ran a bit more frequently because we waited 20 minutes for it to pick us up; we were tired and very ready to get to bed by that point. The shuttle picks up and drops off at federal circle, meaning you need to use the trains to get between the terminal and the shuttle."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"Upon arrival, we were greeted with broken outside barrels and dirty littered grounds.  Lobby was beat with dirty frayed seating. We went to the check-in desk and the hotel worker did not even bother to greet us.  Ironically, we were dropped of at the wrong Hilton.  The very dismissive clerk stated we we were at the wrong location and that the correct hotel was across the highway and NO they would not drive us in the shuttle to their sister hotel. This person made not attempt to help us and proceeded to wave us away from the desk!  The high of their inhospitality was shocking!"
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"My first room, the ac was broken and the toilet tank was messed up. The second room was ok but the toilet tank was also messed up. I got the king room with snacks. Just bring your own. The restaurant food didnt seem appealing and the the store they have was empty. They do offer shuttle service but the guy was kinda rude. For the money spent here, you can probably go somewhere else that better. By far the worst hilton I have stayed"

Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,Easy to get too from JFK free shuttle but shuttle difficult to find. 120 dollars for round trip to Manhattan. But has to be done!staff friendly and helpful.
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"This is the worst hotel I‚Äôve stayed and I‚Äôve been in some sketchy hotels. The AC in my room was broken and was blowing hot air when set on cool. It was a hot summer night so temperature in the room was in the mid 90s. I asked the front desk to change room but was told the rooms were all sold out. They said they would bring a fan into the room, but nothing happened after an hour, and they said they didn‚Äôt have a fan when I asked again. I had to leave at midnight and find another hotel. All this time, the front desk had a bad attitude and was not helpful at all."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,4.0,"This place is a perfect distance from the airport not only is it close to the airport, but the staff was very professional and the rooms were very clean and upgraded parking. Made me feel safe because of the Security around it with using your room key to get in and out of the back parking lot. I will definitely be staying here again very soon."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"DO NOT STAY HERE.  Incredibly scary experience, story below‚Ä¶

I probably would‚Äôve rated this hotel a 2.5 to 3 if it wasn‚Äôt for ‚Äúthe incident‚Äù that happened while we were sleeping that scared the living hell out of us.  An incident where I honestly thought our lives were in danger.

My wife and I slept here after a long day of overseas travel. We were exhausted and jet-lagged, and got to bed early‚Ä¶around 9 pm.

Around midnight, while we are dead asleep, there suddenly is incredibly loud banging on our hotel door.  It‚Äôs not a courteous knock, it‚Äôs a violent knock.  Hard pounding on the door for 10 seconds at a time‚Ä¶a few seconds pause, then more hard pounding.  It sounded like someone is trying to break in. The whole door is shaking very loudly.

This super loud banging goes off and on for about two minutes.  Whoever is loudly banging on our door is not saying anything.  My wife and I are frozen in fear in bed.

Then whoever is outside tries to force himself into our room.  There is even louder bangs against our door, as if someone is throwing their body at it.  This was all so incredibly scary for my wife and I, woken up from a deep sleep, and stuck in our room thinking we‚Äôre about to be mugged (or worse).

I run over to the door and yell ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!  We‚Äôre sleeping!‚Äù

It stops for a few seconds then a man says ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù.

Totally confused I yell back ‚ÄúWhat do you want, we‚Äôre sleeping!‚Äù

He again says ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù

I again say ‚Äúwhat do you want?‚Äù

He then says ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and walks away.

I never opened the door so I didn‚Äôt see what this person looked like.  And I didn‚Äôt get close enough to the door to look through the peephole, because honestly I wasn‚Äôt sure if the person on the other side had a gun; they could‚Äôve shot through the door.  So I cautiously stayed back.

At this point I was feeling a whole range of emotions: scared, irate, confused, heart racing.

Of course there is no way to directly get ahold of the front desk, but I eventually ended up getting to them after calling the Hilton call center and demanding they transfer me to the hotels front desk.

Once transferred, I tell the front desk lady what just happened and demanding to know what the hell is going on.

She seems confused, and then says she‚Äôll ask the housekeeping guy (who was outside).  After a minute or two she comes back on the phone and says he was delivering towels to a room and must have got the wrong room number.

I didn‚Äôt know what to believe.  Also the way this housekeeper was violently banging on the door and then trying to force himself in at midnight was just beyond unacceptable.  Nothing more from the front desk besides a basic ‚Äúsorry about that‚Äù.

I honestly have never been so scared in a hotel room in my life.  My heart was racing the entire rest of the night and I barely slept.

So, do NOT stay at this hotel unless you want to be woken up from a deep sleep by the hotel staff trying to break down your door.

Typing this all back out again has my blood boiling.  I seriously was beyond scared and thought our door was gonna be broken down and we were gonna be violently attacked."

I prepaid the full cost of a one-night stay, only to be shocked by an additional $365.93 charge on my credit card for so-called ‚Äòincidentals‚Äô‚Äîwithout my consent or any prior notice! When I contacted the hotel to dispute this, they initially promised a refund within 3-5 business days. Three weeks later, no refund. Worse, they claimed they couldn‚Äôt locate my reservation!

Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"I've been a Hilton Diamond member for nearly 10 years, and Hilton properties have generally met or exceeded my expectations. Unfortunately, this was by far the most disappointing experience I've had with the brand.

From the moment I checked in, the front desk staff was noticeably rude and impatient. I inquired about the Diamond member breakfast credit, but the representative was unhelpful and dismissive. Although she eventually said it had been applied to my room, I was still charged the full amount the following morning.

To make matters worse, I was also charged twice for parking.

Overall, this experience fell well below Hilton‚Äôs usual standards. I would strongly recommend considering alternative accommodations."

Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,"Most amazing staff from the second we walked in to the second we left. Went here with my gf and stayed for a week, Sunday till Sunday. The rooms are very clean, spacious, pretty. There is a smart tv in the room with Netflix, YouTube, HBO, ect. Soft mattress and (a bit too soft) pillows I sank into. Bathroom was a bit small but big enough to do what you need to do. Room service is great, rooms get cleaned on a daily basis. Breakfast was included for us, we both recommend the sourdough bacon egg and cheese (biggest item on the menu, very generous on the eggs and delicious). It is about a 5-10 minute drive from the jfk airport which is why we choose this location, although rather far from any other places, cities, stores, ect. To go out and do activities outside you must keep in mind it's gonna be about a 45-60 minute car ride to get there. (Which we didn't mind but might be a deal breaker if you wanna be close to the action of the cities). The staff was very nice and helpful at all times. The hotel entrance stays open 24/7 so you can stay out late without having to worry about locked doors when u come back. Can't hear your neighbour hotel goer's through the walls, or in the hallways. Access to laundry room, fitness center (although pretty lackluster) mostly catered towards a quick cardio sesh. Very cosy lobby and breakfast space. All in all a recommendable experience"

Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"From the JFK Federal Circle shuttle stop I called to inquire about a shuttle and was told it will be there shortly. After about 20-min waiting, we ended up taking the Uber.
Longest line I‚Äôve ever seen to just check-in - literally, hundreds of people!!! And just one person working! After an hour of waiting in line, my husband was eventually able to check-in electronically. Getting a digital code took about 20 more minutes - and we finally got the room, unlike the huge crowd of people waiting outside. Not a single shuttle arrived during all this time, by the way.
In the room, the temperature was 81 F, but air conditioning didn‚Äôt work.
All through the night we suffered in the stuffy warm and humid air (didn‚Äôt want to bother the only worker checking people in), but this morning we called THREE times to ask for a technician to come and fix it. Each time we were reassured that someone willl be right there.
Well, we have now checked out, since no one came and fixed it and it‚Äôs impossible to stay in the room at such a temperature and humidity.
The hair conditioner container had no conditioner, either, just an empty container! And the shuttle driver who -we were promised- will take us to the airport - refused to take in three of us, because‚Ä¶. there already were TWO passengers! We don‚Äôt have any luggage with us, so it‚Äôs just the room for three more people! Unbelievable!"
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,2.0,"***HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE*** my husband and I booked a stay 7/25 - 7/28 we arrived on time we had to call the hotel several times before finally getting someone on the phone we called to get shuttle assistance and was told that a uber/lyft would be sent to pick us up the first two Ubers could not find us??? We called a 3rd time and they sent another uber that arrived quick (to be honest I don‚Äôt think the first two Uber/lyft drivers never came). When we arrived to check in there was one young lady at the front desk working check in/out patrons she did not appear to have any front desk support. We waited 30
Minutes to get checked in before we finally got to the room we were assigned (it was small) but neat and clean.  On 7/26 we spent the day away from the room enjoying site in the NYC returning in the evening. Before we left for the day we left the door sign inside the room so that the housecleaning staff could clean the room when we arrived back to the room I was disappointed to see that the bed was poorly made ‚Ä¶ thrown together quickly and they left the dirty towels right where we left them and they never even left clean towels‚Ä¶ they did dump the trash which all that they did. We called the front desk to get clean towels and to report that the room wasn‚Äôt cleaned and that no clean towels were provided the front desk staff had a funky attitude and hung up in my face. A few minutes later we got a knock at our room door it was a male staff person that had two large dry towels my husband asked where were the wash cloths??? He told my husband that he wasn‚Äôt told we needed wash cloths‚Ä¶ well how the heck are we supposed to wash our bodies?? I guess use our hands? His attitude was just as bad as the front desk staff. The customer service was VOID we will of course will finish out our stay at at this location before heading to EGYPT.  We had booked to stay here upon our return from EGYPT BUT that plan has changed we CANCELLED the reservation and will be staying at the Marriott. We visit NYC a few times a year we love staying in Jamaica Queens we have made a note to AVOID this place it may be convenient to be close to the airport however I refuse to pay my hard earned money for a 3-star room where the staff provides shitty customer service."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,"Great location near the airport. Very clean rooms. Good customer service. Easy check-in. I booked through Airbnb, which was cheaper.

Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"Deceptive Practices & Unacceptable Conditions ‚Äì Hilton Should Be Ashamed

I rarely leave reviews, but this experience was so appalling I feel morally obligated to warn others. Hilton should be held accountable for the fraudulent advertising, negligent service, and outright disrespect shown to paying guests at this property.

Why You Should Stay Far Away:

1) Impossible to Reach Anyone:
Need help with your stay? Good luck. Reaching someone is like shouting into the void. I called multiple times over two days trying to confirm the advertised hotel shuttle, only to be transferred in circles and left on hold. When someone did finally answer, I was dumped into yet another automated message, some in Spanish only, with no English translation. The level of disorganization is staggering.

2) Blatantly False Shuttle Advertising:
The only reason I booked this hotel was for the ""free airport shuttle,"" which was clearly advertised on both Hotels.com as operating between 6:00 AM‚Äì9:30 PM and the hotel‚Äôs homepage with no hours listed. But when I landed at JFK, I waited outside for over 30 minutes in the heat with my elderly mother and four suitcases. After multiple calls, holds, and transfers, I received another automated message saying the shuttle was discontinued due to COVID-19‚Ä¶ in 2025? After FINALLY reaching a human being on the phone, I was told the shuttle does operate, but only for specific hours and not during the day. The actual hours are buried deep within their website. There was zero transparency and zero accountability.

3) Intentionally Misleading and Unapologetic:
After checking out, I overheard the front desk answering multiple calls from other guests asking about the shuttle. Clearly, I wasn‚Äôt the only one misled. Even the signage in the hotel lobby fails to list the actual hours. They know this is a recurring issue. They just don‚Äôt care.

4) Run-Down Rooms in Need of Repair
The room was in poor condition. The AC unit clanged so loudly throughout the night that my mother couldn‚Äôt sleep. The Keurig machine overflowed because the provided cups were too small. Not just inconvenient, but sloppy and careless.

Final Verdict:
I will say one positive aspect of this hotel, which earned its 1 star rating from me, that it is better than sleeping outside.

While I waited helplessly for a shuttle that never came, I saw Marriott and DoubleTree shuttles arrive promptly. I‚Äôll be staying there next time and so should you.

This Hilton operates on deception and neglect. If Hilton‚Äôs name is on this building, then shame on them.

Never again."

Lo bueno, tiene servicio de van gratuito al aeropuerto JFK. El servicio es amalble. Si esta limpio.

Tampoco es muy barato para lo que ofrece. Solo es buena opcion si deseas pernoctar cerca del aeropuerto. Y cerca son 13 minutos en auto, mas 10 minutos de caminata dentro del aeropuerto JFK"

The guy that helped us at the front desk was very nice and helpful.

Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"We stayed here due to a cancelled flight. There was construction inside the hotel until 2:00am. Drilling, hammering, dropping things. Breakfast is not included for $315 a night even if you‚Äôre a Hilton member. The shuttle won‚Äôt pick up past 9:30pm. Stay somewhere else."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"Could not be worse than that.
1. Booked 1 week before via Chase portal since we were having an early flight from JFK. Got the confirmation, paid in full etc.
2. Arrived for check in at 9:30 PM to find a chaos in the reception mainly due to the way the reception was ran. The 2 people seemed lost.
3. After waiting 30 min to check in 2 people , we were being told that since we book via a third party they cannot give us a room. They said the same thing to 5 other families. They proposed to give us hotel in Brooklyn ?!?!?!?!!!!
4. We called the manager that arrived very determined but useless in the same time saying the same things. Funny it was when presented the arguments (booking, payment etc) he just left and hide in the office leaving the 2 helpless staff alone again.

Look, if this was a corporate thing (order coming from above) the shame on Hilton. Shame shame shame. You are a disgrace of a company of you refuse prepaid bookings in such a way without providing any email before.
If this was a hotel thing, the Manager is a disgrace for the customer service and he should change job.
The 2 helpers are inocent as a 10yo child."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,"Ugly location but good proximity to airport üõ´  the room was clean and spacious. The walls are thin but luckily my neighbors were mostly quiet.
Good spit if your stranded in NY thanks to jet blue messing it up!"
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"I would not recommend this hotel. We‚Äôve previously stayed at the Hilton JFK and had a far better experience in terms of both service and accommodations.

We made our reservation four months in advance and completed mobile check-in, even selecting our room ahead of time. However, upon arrival, we were handed a key to a room that was already occupied. We were then told that the guests in that room had extended their stay, and no other room was available for us‚Äîdespite having checked in and securing the room in advance.

We had traveled 10 hours and had five other rooms booked at this property for family members. Still, the staff had no solution ready. The front desk was unprofessional and poorly managed. The night manager tried to clean a different room for us herself, but when we entered, it was clearly not cleaned properly‚Äîcrumbs were visible, and the room felt unsanitary.

This ordeal dragged on for over three hours. In the end, we had to come up with our own solution: one of our family members stayed with someone they knew so we could use their room for the night. The night manager never apologized or took real accountability‚Äîher handling of the situation was chaotic and unacceptable.

The next morning, the day manager apologized and offered a refund for the night, which we appreciated, but it didn‚Äôt make up for the frustration and exhaustion we experienced.

Additional issues included being charged $40 per night for parking, only to find the lot full one evening. When we asked what to do with our vehicle, we were simply told we‚Äôd be refunded for that night‚Äôs parking‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt help when you have nowhere to park.

Housekeeping was also unreliable. We specifically requested it the day before checking out and were told rooms were cleaned daily. However, we returned to find our room untouched.

Overall, this was a terrible experience from start to finish. To make matters worse, we were the ones who recommended this hotel to our family‚Äîmany of whom had issues of their own during their stay.

Absolutely would not recommend. 0/10."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"DO NOT STAY HERE! It is not up to par with the Hilton name. We arrived late after an International flight. The shuttle was not available at this hour. The room had a terrible odor, flies, gnats and mosquitoes, and no towels. After complaining, they sent 2 towels for a 3 person reservation, so I had to go get an additional towel. When I shared my concerns the front desk said they would send the manager on duty. About 30 minutes later a man came up, listened and said let me see what we can do. He never returned. The kitchen closed early. When we complained, they finally agreed to give us a very limited, burnt breakfast. It was a terrible experience. Other patrons we spoke with shared the same complaints."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,good price for what it is. Clean room however our key was malfunctioning. But 5 stars for the young Hispanic front desk guy with the glasses who helped us with our room calmly and quickly despite the lobby being packed and chaotic on a Saturday night
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,3.0,"Shuttle goes to federal circle only, you must take the air train to your terminal, or take a taxi to your terminal. Make sure you account for that time in your travel."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,2.0,"Loud guest in the hallways on the 1st floor near the service desk, yet no one asked them to be quite during the late night house. Back door was broken and unsafe as anyone could come in thru it. No urgency from the staff to minimize the overpacked lobby area. Very unsatisfied with this location"
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,Shout out to Romeo--Great front desk service. It was smooth and he was friendly after a long flight.
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"Disappointed. If anything happens and you need to cancel, they will not give you a refund. It is impossible to speak with the manager, whoever it is, never answers any calls. The manager is either not taking the call at all or is never made aware of the call at all. The front desk directs you to someone else, who has no clue what they are talking about. They won't give their name. They try to have you go through a third party to get a refund. Then apparently they fall off the face of the earth because they are never *available* when you call back. If you plan to stay here, make sure you don't have an emergency for any reason because you will be screwed over."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,This hotel is conveniently located near JFK and ideal for overnight stay for flying out or into NYC. A free shuttle is available from the airport and rental car locations and Uber takes just a few mins to the airport .The staff were helpful and the rooms were comfortable. A restaurant is available on site for dinner. Having Hilton Honors membership helps with perks!
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,2.0,"Plumbing issues throughout our room would barely flush and our other friend who stayed in the same hotel as well his entire floor flooded. Also do not pay the extra for "" Snacks and drinks"" after multiple attempts of trying to get these said snacks and drinks I just gave up waiting in line everytime only to be told they would send someone up. Now to be fair the young man at the front desk did give us breakfast vouchers but we never made It for breakfast due to visiting family."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,Excellent Organic food üëå üëç
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"Terrible Hilton I will never use again.  Staff at checkin were rude and the room had an AC unit independent of the room thermostat that sounded like a Diesel tractor preventing sleep (at midnight I realised it was separate and was able to turn it off). There is no vending machine and there were no snacks or other amenities in the lobby or anywhere else in the hotel which meant I was forced to eat in the restaurant.   Be aware it‚Äôs also under JFK flightpath and the rooms are not soundproofed so good luck getting an early night.  Very poor experience, I should have checked other reviews. Avoid"
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,They don‚Äôt even deserve one star the American air line lady said the 8 star hotel but no bad service there shuttle stops welter then others  and bad customer service
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,"Hotel experience real good, easy check-in, clean rooms and bathrooms. Real quiet room and everything organize also is really close to the airport. Hotel shuttle to the airport very efficient."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,"Very clean with friendly staff.  I recommend this place for sure.
The only down is that shuttle operated at specific time, which is not beneficial if your flight does not fall in their operating window."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,1.0,"This particular Hikton hotel will never be visited by me or used by my team again!

My team sent a delegation to Africa and needed to book rooms due to flight changes. We chose this hotel since we had reasonably good experiences with the Hilton brand elsewhere. On arrival, my team discovered that the reservation was cancelled without any prior communication. The team was also treated poorly, practically left stranded at odd hours of the a.m. and there was no assistance provided by the hotel staff for the inconvenience. They did not even mention refunding the reservation! This is not even second-rate customer service (CS). This is no CS @ all. I have a reasonably large team, and we will absolutely NOT recommend this trash of a place!"
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,4.0,Clean sheets for unanticipated layovers.
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,4.0,"Wasn't a bad stay, however roads are awful and you have to be very careful when driving especially at nights. There was a minor construction happening that made the areas a bit hot at check in, in the hallways and elevator. My room wasn't back however I did return one day to the front cover of the AC unit on the floor."
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,2.0,"Two nights and 3 days and never cleaned the room
We did live the room in the morning and at night room never cleaner
Askim for some stuff never come
So we did spent very bad time
You never see me again"
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,"Stayed here on 4/25/25 to be close to JFK for a very early flight. Had a great experience. Romeo checked us in and he was AMAZING. The front lobby was very busy and Romeo handled everybody with ease and with a smile. Fastest check in experience I've ever had. He was very informative, was very nice, he knew exactly what time we should leave the hotel to get to JFK in relation to when our flight was and what the lines would be like and he reserved us car service for the morning to get us to the airport. The room was perfect for our needs. The restaurant (open late) was perfect for not having to get out and about.  The shuttle to and from JFK was great. I returned our rental car the day we checked in so we could sleep a little more before our flight and I was able to get back to the hotel via the shuttle. Everything was so easy! Perfect hotel to stay at when needing to catch an early flight!!"
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,3.0,The park and stay is why we used this hotel. We spent 12 hours here and our car spent 8 days. Our flights were too early or late for the shuttle but Uber dropped us at the terminal and a cab brought us back without using the AirTrain at JFK.
Hilton Garden Inn Queens/JFK Airport,5.0,"They have great rooms that have TV, bathrooms, and comfortable beds, plus the rooms have charging and plug ports to charge your phones and other devices. They also have great room service and housekeeping to clean and tidy the rooms, so come on down and check-in to your vacation place to have a great time with friends and families."

We decided to stay at a different hotel when I asked if I could get a refund they said yes. , but not money has been refunded. Definitely not staying there anymore."

Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,Clean and close to jfk. Staff is good. Bar food just ok. Quimby Restaurant very good.
Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Rafael at the Q Bar at The Quimby is an amazing bartender and host. We met him late night with a bar-full of tired travelers‚Äî many like us missed their connections! He was calm and collected and made everyone feel at home & okay with their travel issues. He also made great cocktails!
Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"We didn‚Äôt have much time to experience the hotel, arrived and gone in 7 hours. But good location from a brief stay at JFK airport."

Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"We had a wonderful stay in a 2 Queen, M club level room. We were all jet lagged from an overseas flight, so it was nice that check-in was fast. The buffet breakfast was by far the best I‚Äôve had at any Marriott location and all of the staff were friendly and helpful, especially the attendant managing the breakfast, Fortune. She prepares an amazing breakfast and is also so friendly and helpful."
Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"I would go so far as to call this the best JFK airport hotel. Reliable shuttle, clean rooms, and good restaurant/MClub Lounge located within. It‚Äôs always busy so be prepared."

Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"I chose the Marriot for a one-night layover after a 16h flight from Hong Kong. I first looked at cheaper options (by Marriot) nearby, but all had some kind of bad reviews, so I decided to pay a bit more - totally happy with my choice. The shower is great, 20 minutes of hot water no problem, beds are comfy, rooms are quiet, proper 24/7 gymn, and the shuttle service uses a simple app - had like a 3-minute wait time. Overall great service, can highly recommend :-)"
Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Great Hotel to stay with families. Express check in provided by reception staff Deshaunje( Sorry if i spell your name incorrectly) Comfy bed with all necessary amenities for visitors. Neat & clean rooms and restrooms. Ample pillows on the bed and ample towels made available. Please ignore bad reviews as it feels like people wanted to use reviews for personal gains thats my honest opinion as an international traveller. They have charged 150$ for deposit which should be returned within 7 days. I will keep that update posted as well.
Best part is their free shuttle to Fed circle station."
Marriott New York JFK Airport,2.0,Really a super busy area!
Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"This hotel was lovely. We had to stay here when our flights home got cancelled and they were very kind and accommodating. The restaurant and bar stay open late & the food and drinks were delicious.

Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,It was insanely busy. Cannot believe how many people come in and out of that place daily. But I've been in smaller airports less organized.
Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"The M Club was one of the best I‚Äôve seen.  New hotel with complimentary shuttle to JFK. View from the room was great for airport views. Staff was exceptional. The Quimbly restaurant had a great staff, especially our server Shantaya. The food was ok, but we arrived 30 minutes before closing so end of day may explain that."
Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Wow, just wow. My husband and i were hesitant to stay at this the mariott, but upon arrival the ambiance at the lobby was oh so cozy, friendly  and clean. We had our food and drink, and to tell you the food was good would be an understatement. The food was mouth watering. We were enjoying the view and then we met one of the associates kevin, he was very welcoming, professional, knowledgeable, he helped us so well. He must be commended for his kind support to us. Kevin and the Marriot exceeded our expectations and yes we love it. Hoping to see you again soon. Keep up thegood work guys"

Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"The moment my friend and I stepped in the hotel after the worse flying experience of our lives, we immediately felt a sense of relief and this was thanks to the welcoming presence of Emanuel at the drink desk.
The rooms are amazing as well."
Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,Beautiful view from the Lounge to the airport
Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"Avoid This Airport Parking Lot Like the Plague, you‚Äôd be better off leaving your car on the street, windows down, doors wide open, keys in the ignition, and a handwritten note that says, ‚Äúpublic toilet‚Äù At least then you wouldn‚Äôt have to suffer dealing with the absolute disaster that is parking here.

The¬†customer service is nonexistent. Calling it ""poor"" would be giving it far too much credit. You‚Äôd get more empathy from a brick wall. The attendants treat you like you‚Äôve interrupted their very important nap time. Questions are met with eye-rolls, confusion, or outright hostility. Get ready to be ignored or, worse, blamed.

There is¬†no price worth this abuse, no deal good enough to justify the level of frustration and risk you‚Äôre signing up for.

Avoid parking here at all costs. Park literally anywhere else‚Äîon a random side street, in a muddy ditch, or next to a burning dumpster‚Äîyou‚Äôll have a better experience.

Zero stars. Negative stars, if that were possible."
Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,Convenient location close to JFK airport very helpful staff the airport shuttle runs 24/7.
Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,I needed just one night by JFK. This hotel is modern and beautiful. The front desk service was wonderful. A huge added bonus is the free shuttle to JFK. I highly reccomend if you need to be close to JFK.
Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Our trip was fantastic from start to finish, and I especially want to comment about the housekeeping manager - Cassie. My daughter accidentally left her Kindle in the room, and I misplaced my AirPods somewhere in the hotel. Cassie went above and beyond, dedicating significant time and effort to help us locate both items. Her exceptional dedication and customer service truly stood out; I'm not sure another manager would have shown such commitment. We are incredibly grateful for her help!  I would go there again in a heartbeat thanks to her."

Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"had an outstanding experience thanks to Shaundaya at the Marriott! She went above and beyond with her follow-up, ensuring every detail was handled with care and professionalism. Her customer service was truly exceptional ‚Äî warm, attentive, and thorough from start to finish. It‚Äôs rare to find someone so committed to excellence, and she made a lasting impression. Thank you, Shaundaya, for your dedication and top-notch service!"
Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"We had a wonderful stay at the Marriott JFK Airport! The staff were incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to make our travel experience smooth and comfortable.

They kindly allowed my parents to temporarily park while meeting us at the hotel, which made things so much easier during a hectic travel day. The team also arranged for warm milk for our baby without hesitation‚Äîsuch a thoughtful touch that meant a lot to us.

Upon check-in, the staff made sure all of our luggage was brought to the rooms promptly, and everyone we interacted with was genuinely helpful and welcoming. It‚Äôs rare to see this level of hospitality and attention to detail at an airport hotel.

Highly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre flying in or out of JFK. Great service, comfortable rooms, and a team that truly cares."

Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Had to stay here for a night to be close to JFK. The room rate was high, but those are just market forces. The shuttle was extremely convenient and the room and the bed was super comfortable. The stand out though was the staff. They were extremely friendly courteous, and you could tell that they weren‚Äôt just phoning it in - they were trained very well and being very genuine.

I ended up leaving my sunglasses in my room and they found them and ship them back to me very properly. Great place would stay again. !"
Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,1.0,I was disappointed in my stay at this hotel. I had problems with my TV and getting in touch with the manager. I had issues with getting clean towels. I did not like the location of this hotel.
Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,5.0,"We recently stayed at this hotel for one night while attending a family event. The check-in process was efficient, and the front desk staff was both professional and welcoming. The accommodations were clean and well-maintained. The only minor drawback was the absence of a full-length mirror in our room. However, this did not detract from our overall positive experience. I would certainly consider staying here again in the future. Thank you for the hospitality."
Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,5.0,Perfect if you need to use JFK. Super clean and comfortable. Nice staff. Valet parking. I love it.
Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,5.0,"I had a good (although short) experience at the Fairfield Inn near JFK Airport. It‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a Marriott value chain: clean, reliable, and with friendly service. The staff was helpful, even with a late-night arrival, and I really appreciated that they arranged transportation to and from the airport. It‚Äôs a very convenient option if you need a comfortable place to stay before or after a flight."

Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,2.0,"Was told the shuttle takes 15 minutes. I‚Äôm in the shuttle right now at 8:15, we haven‚Äôt even gotten to the first terminal yet. If we knew this we would have gotten an uber. If you‚Äôre staying here, don‚Äôt rely on the shuttle, just get an uber.

Updates. Arrived at 8:46 AM.

When you find a hotel near the airport with a free shuttle system‚Ä¶ the expectations is to get to the airport within 20 minutes at least‚Ä¶

I would avoid this hotel only for this reason.

Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Excellent Service Despite a Tough Night

While traveling, I had a layover at JFK and chose to stay at the Fairfield by Marriott. When I called the hotel, I could tell the person working the night shift was overwhelmed ‚Äî he was handling everything by himself and had to put me on hold for a while. I later found out the hotel shuttle was broken, and he was receiving a lot of calls.

Despite all of that, as soon as he got back on the line, he immediately arranged a Lyft to pick me up. I was really impressed with how the hotel went out of its way to make sure I was taken care of. I also asked if he could store my medicine in the freezer, and he gladly did it without hesitation.

He never complained or mentioned how busy he was, but it was clear he was juggling a lot. Still, he remained professional and helpful the entire time. That kind of dedication and service deserves to be recognized. Thank you!"

Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,5.0,"I stayed at the Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport for a night before a flight out of JFK the next day. This hotel is in a great location very close to the airport. Rooms were small but very functional. No issues with room cleanliness or service. I can't speak to the shuttle service to the airport, as the hotel booked a taxi for us. I recommend this hotel if you need an airport hotel near JFK."
Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,5.0,"We tired this hotel for our recent trip out of JFK. Had an early morning flight so wanted to not deal with construction traffic so stayed night before trip. Small but functional and quiet room. They offered guaranteed parking and have a 24 hr valet attendant and that sold us since we have had experiences
In past of parking not being available at JFK hotels after we showed up to hotel. Hotel clean and they offered breakfast but wasn‚Äôt yet open when we left at 6 am. They also offered a shuttle but it goes only once an hour and you can‚Äôt sign up for it until you check in, so we opted to park one night then drive to an off site parking spot near by. Would definitely stay here in future trips especially since we prefer Marriott hotels."

Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,5.0,I spent the night at Fairfield when I had an evening flight that landed in and my final leg home was the next day. I really enjoyed the great customer service from the two young ladies who helped checked me in and the gentleman who helped me during check out the next morning. The lady who prepared the kitchen welcomed me to some fruit and chocolate milk before breakfast opening time. The free shuttle was also a great help with a very helpful and cheerful driver that made you feel welcomed from the beginning. Wow! So sweet and customer service represented well here! The only problem was that my toilet wouldn't flush. I only used the bathroom twice so it wasn't a big ordeal. The front desk clerk took care of it at check out. The room I stayed in was very comfortable and clean. Very clean! I highly recommend. I'm a Marriot reward member.

Fairfield Inn New York JFK Airport,3.0,"Boss: Okay, we're going to build an airport hotel. Everyone staying here will have LOTS of luggage.
Anyone got some ideas on how we should start?

Idiotic designer: YEAH! I've got a great idea. How about we put the entrance and check in desks in a nice reception area, but then have a flight of steps you have to go down in order to get to the elevators that take you to the rooms!

Boss: Hmmm, that sounds okay, but what about all the heavy luggage?

Idiotic designer: Well, I suppose we could put in an elevator you can ride down in to then go up in the other elevators

Boss: Great. It'll be big enough for a family and all their luggage

Idiotic designer: Uhhh, yes, well, maybe a family of one‚Ä¶oh, and you'll have to turn 90‚Å∞ because the entry and exit doors will be on different sides of the elevator

Crazy

Valet parking only, but he was a nice guy and shared my disdain at the new BMW 5 series' ""everything is computer"" and lack of physical buttons

Room was nice but hotel is near a busy intersection so is quite noisy

Great location for JFK"

They told us it was $45 a night per vehicle and at no time did they mention or show on their website that it‚Äôs $55 for ‚ÄúBig‚Äù vehicles. Then they want to tell us after telling us otherwise that the night we stayed there did not include parking so that was also added onto the bill with the parking from when we were on vacation. They would not work with us or apologize for the false information. Not impressed at all!

Casa Azul Hotel,2.0,Mucho ruido. Caro por lo que es
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,"Experiencia fatal mi novio Y yo estuvimos de visita en Nueva York decidimos quedarnos en ese hotel porque nos quedaba cerca de la entrada del tren para poder visitar la ciudad!
Preguntamos precio nos dijeron que por no fumar eran m√°s alto el precio decidimos coger el cuarto
No se ubicaron en primer piso lo cual nos pareci√≥ raro pensamos que estaba en remodelamiento porque el piso estaba con Clear Tape o Dog Tape pegado no tomamos importancia pensamos que era remodelaci√≥n
Pusimos nuestras cosas dentro del cuarto aunque tuvimos dificultad para abrir la puerta tuvimos que ir a que nos abriera luego nos fuimos a coger el tren porque ya era
Regresamos por la noche pero al querer usar ba√±o Toilet y tina de ba√±o nos dimos cuenta que nada funcionaba, Quise hacer una llamada a la oficina el tel√©fono desconectado , Hablamos con mantenimiento una joven y un caballero dijeron que no pod√≠an hacer nada nos dieron email de la oficina del Manager el cual no responde hasta este momento para la queja que tuvimos porque hab√≠an bedbugs, S√°banas sucias reo de pelo en las almohadas toallas con manchas amarillas un desastre completo! Por favor si andan con familia con ni√±os no visiten en este hotel cero recomendaci√≥n por salud, Y los empleados que son Prepotentes no saben qu√© contestar sucio sucio sucio voy a llamar al departamento de sanidad que vayan a checarlo de eso me voy a encargar yo"
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,"This location has horrible customer service, the front desk lady is very rude. I can see why you guys have 2 stars because of your unprofessional workers. I don‚Äôt recommend coming here, the rooms are not even cleaned properly I know it‚Äôs cheap but damn."
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,"I visited the hotel for one night my wife and I decided to stay where smoking is not allowed on the first floor that was assigned to us they charged us extra for not smoking when we entered the room a total disaster there was no hot water the bed smelled bad cockroaches and suddenly my wife comes in and two mice come out we had to leave the place immediately because the stress and anger could more how can it be that this place is open full of animals we made the complaint to the receptionist a young woman who does not speak English very well I think she is from India or the Middle East she could not solve anything for us she gave us the email of the boss whom we contacted and to this day we have not received a response to see what she can do about it if she returns us part of the money my recommendation is not to visit this place because there is a lot of crime there and the service is terrible a young man cleaning there is no shampoo no soap and the used paper left by other clients is what you take with you smells bad the floor is covered with Clear Tape incredible 21st century and these owners of places continue with these places they should close them! One mistake is that the place looks good from the outside, they serve you well when they charge you, but when you enter the room it's like being on the street, there's no water, no telephone line, the beds smell bad, there are rats, cockroaches and the floor hasn't been cleaned yet."

Casa Azul Hotel,3.0,"I booked a room with this hotel thru Booking.com. When we got there we proceeded to check in the lady asked me how I was going to pay with cash or card. I told her that I payed already. She acted confused for a while, I showed her the proof of payment and she was mumbling at the same time she was looking at the computer. I didn‚Äôt like the interaction. She was rude. She gave us the key, but with her confused face still. The place was very clean and the location was good. The bed was very comfy. If will stay again??? Maybe, but like I always said, kindness and being nice it‚Äôs free."
Casa Azul Hotel,2.0,The only thing good about this place is that it's a doable walk to the UBS arena and the staff was courteous. Otherwise I can't recommend.... very dirty rooms that smell
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,"DO NOT STAY HERE !!! The keycard for the door was difficult to unlock , and when the door did unlock you had to practically kick it down to get inside. The TV was left on very high volume inside the room. There was no fitted sheet and the bedspread was very poor. The pillows on the bed were very very thin, almost like a bunch of newspaper shoved into a pillow case. The bathroom looked nice upon entering. But the towels were so dirty they were unusable. The towels had yellow stains, dirt stains and holes in them, aswell as being covered in random hairs. The floor was slippery and the shower floor was dirty. The door into the room had a huge crack which allowed light from the hallway to shine directly to the bed, and you could hear EVERYTHING that happened outside of the room. The lamps in the room did not have any shades, and only one of them worked.

Even though I only stayed for one night I find the condition of this hotel very poor and would not reccomend staying here."
Casa Azul Hotel,5.0,Seems like a nice 1 night stand spot to bring your local 304 pretty clean at least I didn't leave itching
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,"This hotel should be investigated and shut down . Extremely disgusting ! The whole building smells like cigarettes and looks like a trap house . Definitely suspicious activity going on in this ‚Äúhotel‚Äù . I  checked out 3 rooms before finally settling for one that was still mediocre. Their were young adults walking up and down the hallways at all hours of the night, yelling and blasting music . Suspicious people throughout the building. They were either selling drugs or smoking it. Trash out in the hallways , empty Hennessy bottles. The rooms were dirty as hell, extremely dusty and stank ! just completely unsat! I didn‚Äôt even look in the bathroom. Honestly didn‚Äôt want to touch a thing . I did not feel safe while sleeping here . I had to block the door with a desk because the locks seemed to have been messed with. The windows were closed but unlocked upon arrival, just waiting for someone to break in while you sleep. I sat up the whole time I was there . Arrived at 12 am and left before 6 . I ran out of there as fast as I could . I will be reporting This hotel  to the department of health . It should be shut down ! don‚Äôt be fooled by the pictures . This hotel does NOT look like that in real life !"

Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,I booked the wrong date on my reservation and they refused to refund me back my money. And I booked a room with them for the night even though the error was made. Now they refunded me $10.50 and they took $590. They are thieves and I hope there customer service is horrible! I will never in my life come there and recommend anyone to stay here.
Casa Azul Hotel,5.0,Nice room
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,"They charged me for a luxury king room. I got dropped down to a regular king room due to the plumbing not working, tv not working. Staff told me it was nothing they can do to refund my money for the downgrade. The luxury only means you get a couch in the room. Do not be fooled. The room smelled like weed and cigarettes. Disaster all around."

Casa Azul Hotel,5.0,Very nice
Casa Azul Hotel,3.0,Could be better
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,"Upon arrival, I was assigned a room that was clearly not cleaned to acceptable standards. The tub was visibly dirty, there were red speckles of debris on the comforter (which was supposed to be blue), the bed lights were non-functional, and the overall noise level was excessive. I immediately brought these concerns to the attention of the front desk. While the staff member I spoke with was kind and accommodating and reassigned me to another room, the situation unfortunately worsened.

The second room presented multiple hygiene concerns as well. Nearly all of the towels and washcloths were visibly dirty‚Äîonly one was usable. The tub was again unclean, and the bed sheets and pillows also appeared used and unsanitary. I have attached photos of the linen as evidence.

Due to the unacceptable conditions, I could not comfortably use the bed and had no choice but to sleep upright in the desk chair, which I deemed the least hazardous option. This experience completely disrupted my ability to rest and recharge after a long day of work, defeating the entire purpose of my stay.

It is deeply frustrating to encounter such conditions, especially at a property advertised as ‚ÄúPleasant‚Äù on Booking.com. My experience was quite the opposite‚Äîunhygienic, stressful, and exhausting."
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,"DO NOT BOOK HERE. Trust me. I booked for one night thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôs just for a night‚Äù and instantly regretted. Receptionist was yelling and swearing at us, gave us a dirty room with drug residue and food on the floor, locks were broken on door, refused to give us a manager to talk to or give us a refund. Absolute worst hotel experience I‚Äôve had. Even for only  $140 I contemplated just taking a loss & going somewhere else. Wish I could give 0 stars."
Casa Azul Hotel,5.0,Muy buena estancia
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,the lady is working today she is not friendly at all. her attitude looks like she doesn‚Äôt want to work. always using phone.
Casa Azul Hotel,1.0,"This place has horrible service. I used to put up with this place as the rooms were decent enough that I could brush aside the godawful poor service but today was the final straw.
I booked a week‚Äôs stay at the hotel and misplaced my reservation information. As I had a lurking suspicion I was supposed to checkout today I decided to check in with the front staff before I left for the day to see if my reservation was still good or if I needed to pay for an extra night. THEY REASSURED ME I WAS BOOKED FOR THE NIGHT. Lo and behold when I returned later that night they had removed all of my belongings from the room, without even bothering to notify me via call/text or e-mail ahead of time, stating that my reservation had expired.
This place is absolute trash and I recommend that they be avoided like the plague."
Casa Azul Hotel,4.0,I only went to sleep and spend some time with my partner. I did get there pretty late like around 11:30 p.m. and left the next morning at 8:00 a.m. so I can't really say much about the place it was quiet for me and I did get good service from the staff
Casa Azul Hotel,5.0,"Bathroom Beautiful(Just need updated), it‚Äôs few broken things and rust in some corners or areas of the room that needs fixed but overall room was beautiful.

Had to get an Uber, so it added more $ to this already overpriced place. Asked for a voucher off my bill for uber. They wouldn‚Äôt do it. Then emailed them about the whole situation. No response back. Save yourself the headache and avoid this place."

Hampton Inn NY-JFK,5.0,Good and professional service by Aniket ! Great service
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,4.0,"Hotel is located very near to JFK airport. Biggest negative of this hotel is the car parking and entering and exiting the hotel by car. They offer free Tea and Coffee which is kept in the lobby. Since it is near to the hotel, it is always crowded. They offer free shuttle to the Airport and they were kind enough to send a mini van only for our family. Room sizes are decent."

Hampton Inn NY-JFK,4.0,"The room was clean but aspects showed a little wear.  The staff, including the shuttle drivers were great.

Hampton Inn NY-JFK,4.0,"Made a booking for my daughter who was traveling overseas for the first time by herself. Reservation was made via Delta/SkyMiles Itinerary # 73079555480836 for May 20th, 2025-May 21st 2025. Found out that minimum age for check in was 21 and since my daughter was slightly under the age, we called to see if she would have problems checking in. They said she could not check in. So we asked to cancel the reservation as no adult would have been able to check her in. We were told that it would be without penalty due to the circumstances. However, despite communication with Delta/Expedia the hotel has now refused to refund the points/charges.

Edit to the review. After much communication with Expedia and Delta it was determined that Hampton Inn had not charged for the room and the refund was the responsibility of Expedia. Expedia initially was not helpful but after several exchanges, a refund to frequent flier miles was issued on 7/27/2025. Therefore Hampton Inn in all fairness was not responsible for this issue."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,"If you‚Äôre looking for a filthy hotel, with disgusting rooms and humiliating service - this is the hotel for you.
If you call for their shuttle to pick you up from JFK, it‚Äôll take 50 minutes. The ride is btw just 7 minutes. But if you call (again and again) they‚Äôll lie to you saying the driver is on his way. They even use an App ‚Äútrackmyshuttle‚Äù that kept on showing that the driver was 6 minutes away‚Ä¶for 42 minutes‚Ä¶
Mold and dirt in the bathroom. Essentials missing there.
The breakfast area was so dirty and stinking that I skipped.
Even the carpet that welcomes you at the reception is the dirtiest I‚Äôve ever seen.
Their staff? Jean at the reception and Pilo the driver? Two liars.

Hampton Inn NY-JFK,4.0,"Stayed there for a night as our flight was leaving early in the morning. Staff was friendly, room was good but unfortunately the toilet flush was kinda weird. It filled up with water and then took like 2 minutes until the water was gone again. As we were only there for a short time and didn‚Äôt realize until later in the evening we didn‚Äôt bother telling them right then. We only had 3 bath towels in the room, called that we needed a 4th which we got a few minutes later. We got breakfast bags as we were leaving before breakfast opened. (A bagel, peanut butter, grape jelly, apple and a water bottle). The shuttle to the Air Train station was on time and fast. I‚Äôd totally recommend if you fly in late or out early."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,5.0,"This is certainly on the higher end for the Hampton family of Hilton. Great rooms, solid amenities, but the hero of the battle was the receptionist Melissa, who made our stay spectacular. Flexible, caring, supportive - I wish I could have an Army of Melissa‚Äôs on my team. Well done, highly recommend."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,3.0,"Definitely on the far low end of the Hampton Inns I have stayed at. The rooms are a bit worn, our curtains wouldn't close, we had to wait almost 40 minutes for the shuttle from JFK (despite calling), and morning shuttles to the airport were full. Uber is not very expensive based on the location. The highlights were a compact but varied morning buffet which provided amble choices and overall good food quality; and the proximity to JFK Airport."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,2.0,"Extremely basic and below the standards of other Hampton inns we‚Äôve stayed in. Sure, it‚Äôs just for airport layovers but spruce the place up! Our room also had a dank smell probably from a leaking air conditioner (wet carpet there). Getting here from jfk was not good. Their app/ website shuttle reservations system was clunky and lacked clear instructions. You have to take the train (air train? Look for signs at the airport) to federal circle in order to catch the shuttle. Not at all convenient but JFK is a mess right now."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,5.0,We haven‚Äôt stayed here but we did park our car and use their shuttle service to/from JFK Airport. We had a smooth drop off and pick up. But what made it exceptional was Govinda and the staff quickly assisting us back to the airport as we realized we left our bag. They calmed our nerves and got us back to the airport in a timely manner. We appreciate their kindness and work ethic! Will definitely park here again when flying in/out of JFK.
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,"Aucun respect pour les clients une fois que le paiement est encaiss√©.
Impossible de contacter l'hotel, ni par mail, ni par t√©l√©phone et ni par la platforme de r√©servation. Le personnel profite d'un emplacement pratique pr√™s de l'a√©roport. Dommage."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,4.0,"Valet parking--make a parking reservation separately from your room reservation, since a spot isn't guaranteed,..or so they said."

Hampton Inn NY-JFK,5.0,"Life changing experience. This is the absolute best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in. Think white lotus second series, but better. The building was architecturally exquisite and the rooms beautifully appointed. The signature sent scent of the room ‚Äúpisse de chat‚Äù was very comforting upon arriving and gave it a very bougie feeling. So impressed was I with the overall experience and beautiful surroundings that I am planning on renewing my vows at the hotel with my extended family and friends to share this joyful experience with everyone. I can‚Äôt stress enough how essential it is to stay at this destination hotel when visiting manhattan. Also it is very conveniently located to ensure only a 10 hour journey by foot or 3 hours by lime scooter. If you were questioning if should visit Manhattan here‚Äôs your reason to go. This is the most off the scale luxury I have ever experienced if I died now I‚Äôd be so content as nothing can top this."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,"La experiencia en este hotel ha sido nefasta, el desayuno era una aut√©ntica basura, el suelo del hotel estaba pegajoso y la zona del desayuno tambi√©n.

Las habitaciones no eran para nada c√≥modas, las camas del hotel se hund√≠an f√°cilmente con el peso normal y la limpieza brillaba por su ausencia

Lo √∫nico bueno del hotel por decir algo es la rapidez por la que se desacen de la fianza, y el servicio de shuttle al aeropuerto, con el chico que lleva esa furgoneta, que es muy amable y servicial , un saludo al Puerto rique√±o si lee esto.

El servicio del hotel por lo dem√°s es una aut√©ntica basura."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,2.0,"Allow us to shut the curtains!!! What could be the logic behind shining a bright light into our rooms and not letting us shut the curtains!! I am updating my review because we were able to block out the light, but hotels are for sleeping, so this is something that needs fixing. There is potential for improvement."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,4.0,This hotel could do with some upgrade in the rooms and bathroom. It's busy and noisy.
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,4.0,"Nice hotel for airport travelers. Very friendly staff. Clean. Breakfast was good- eggs, meat, potatoes, waffles, breads, cereals and yogurt plus more. Kept pretty well stocked and clean. Room is nice size. Not big, but efficient."

Don‚Äôt stay there it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt worth the money I will not stay there even for free! Hilton corp need to be a shame for what the giving to the customer unbelievable!!!!"
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,"I landed late to JFK on 6/26 and arrived here and was advised that there was no shuttle available for the time I needed to get back to my train(at the airport) in the morning, so I was out of luck.  Then there was no water in the shower, not even cold water to run it.  I had to leave in the morning so I didn't have time to wait for a repair; there was no ETA.  I asked the front desk if there was something they could do, i.e. compensation for not having what the room should come with....i.e. a working shower.  I was told no, and handed the card of their GM.

I ended up leaving in the morning with no shower and ubering to the airport circle to get back to a train.

I sent a note to the GM, who ghosted me, so I called Hilton Honors to open a case.  No word back, I assume they are waiting on that same worthless GM to provide corporate with a comment.

This place has no business being affiliated with Hilton.  Do not under any circumstances stay here."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,"Arrived at midnight, waited to check in for ever. There were two people on duty, but one was busy taking care of complaining customers while the other checked in people. We picked this hotel because of the airport shuttle. When we checked in, they told us it was full and would not pay for a cab. The key did not work 3 times and finially they gave us another room. Room was what you would expect. Then in the morning there was no water preasure and I had to skip the shower. When I went down to the lobby, there was again a crowd and I just left. I called Hilton, and we both left messages for the general manger and she would not call back."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,They lost my reservation. Chelsea gave me an attitude. I was offered zero compensation. I ended up paying over $500 to stay here on a Wednesday on a cot no less. Not sure how many stars they are expecting.
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,3.0,It's close to the airport. The bar is expensive but good and on-site.
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,3.0,"The good is that rooms are clean and everyone we encountered was super nice. Bad is that the first room we got reeked of weed but they were quick to change it for us. The thing that made us most angry was we asked valet at check in if we needed to do anything to get the shuttle to airport and they said nope, just show up. We got down at 450 for 5am shuttle and driver asked if we were on the list?! What?! Told us it was booked so we ended up having to take a ride share.
Apparently there is a list so keep asking until you find someone who will put you on it. Good luck."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,3.0,"We had a one night after a long international flight and we arrived later and all we wanted was to shower. The nice lady advised us that there was no hot water. They did fix it in the morning but I was surprised  that no compensation was offered.
I do think that was in order as this is part of the service we pay for when we book a hotel.
They did offer a free shuttle and a baggy with water apple and a bagel in the morning as the flight was early and we missed the complementary breakfast.
Over all I would recommend it but again I think there should have been accommodation to the bill when something like this occurs."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,2.0,"I have been here numerous times and this is the first time that I felt my stay was unpleasant. There was no hot water at any given time for days.
Anytime you‚Äôre staying at a hotel and have to go to families homes to bathe, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs considered just plain horrible."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,2.0,Cold shower.  Would not heat up.  Was told there would be coffee for 5am shuttle.  No coffee. Only 3 towels and 1 washcloth.  Booked for 4 people.
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,3.0,"Arrived at this hotel after a day at work, and first experience was the shuttle driver pulling into the valet parking area, parking, then getting on his phone and walking around the corner while I waited in my vehicle to approach the entrance of the building‚Ä¶ after about 10 min of waiting to see if he would come back (he didn‚Äôt), I parked behind him on the ramp leading to the building and went in to check in for my reservation‚Ä¶ The line for check in was unorganized, and people were standing and waiting, clearly unpleased, crossing their arms as they watched the staff behind the desk fumble with the simplest of tasks. While waiting in line, I overheard conversations about other guests who were having issues with their showers not working, their key cards not working, unclean rooms, and other grievances. Once it was finally my turn to check in, I was ‚Äúgreeted‚Äù by Ankit‚Ä¶ And by which, I mean he meagerly gestured at the now vacant spot in front of the counter where the previous guest stood. Ankit asked for my ID, which is typical, then told me that the reservation I had made was declined (I paid in advance) and I showed him the charge for the room. He said that unfortunately he could not check me in unless I paid in person and that he would ‚Äúreverse the previous charge‚Äù. Already tired from my day and not wanting to argue, I provided my card (same one I had used previously) and he promptly charged it again.

After receiving my room key, I went back to move my vehicle and finally encountered a staff member with some decency and good customer service. The valet staff apologized to me as they were out of space for parking on site, but helped me find a spot fairly close as street parking and thanked me for my understanding.

Upon finally getting back into the building and heading to my room, as I approached the door, I saw something was off - the door to my room was already cracked open. I opened the door cautiously, thinking maybe the desk staff gave me the wrong key and I was potentially given the number to another guests room‚Ä¶ But it was empty. What I did come to find however, is that the room absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke, and there was nothing subtle about it.

So I went back down to the desk to ask for a different room, and explained the smoke smell, when the girl at the desk beside Ankit asked which Room number. ‚Äú312‚Äù I told her; to which she replied ‚ÄúOh! We were just talking about that room!‚Äù And they laughed about it as Ankit showed me a pile of discarded key sleeves with ‚Äú312‚Äù on them as if they‚Äôve been trying to pass off the room to guests all night‚Ä¶

I could go on more about my experience here; but having worked for Hilton myself, and being a Hilton Honors member‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sad to say that this has probably been one of the worst Hilton properties I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of staying at. My advice; unless you absolutely have no other choice; avoid this place‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs simply not worth it."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,2.0,One of the worst chain airport hotels I have ever visited.    Room was dingy and furniture and carpets worn out.  Took a cold shower this morning with almost no water pressure.  Staff seems indifferent and detached.    I will never stay here again.  Worst Hampton an  I have experienced
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,"This is the worst hotel I‚Äôve ever been in. We tried to use mobile check in but were informed their system didn‚Äôt work. We arrived around 9 pm to at least ten people in line in front of us. This was our concern and why we kept trying to use mobile check in. As we are waiting the fire department showed up. Now the tiny lobby is crazy crowded. The gentleman at the desk was trying to help, but there were lots of people needing something. Some woman with a name badge indicating she is the front office supervisor would come out look at us and go back somewhere. She came out answered the phone and told the person to hold for this poor guy. We get up to our room and there is no water. Called the desk tells us he knows and no idea when we will have water. I sat on the chair at the desk which leaned all the way over and broke. We decided to just try to sleep. I got in bed and there are pieces of metal sticking up through the sheets! No idea what that is. The fridge is luke warm at best. The bathroom sink reminds me of what you‚Äôd see in a small RV. The carpet is so dirty I kept my shoes on. The room reeks of smoke but they claim it‚Äôs non-smoking.

The next morning we got up and we had water but only cold water. Called again and clearly they knew but just said we will let them know. The tv barely works, the internet is a joke, the staff ignores you. Went down to breakfast and guests who appear to be long term stay guests have completely taken over the area. They have stuff everywhere like it‚Äôs their home and were very rude. We gave up. Still no water and we need to catch a 6 hour flight to Iceland! Absolutely disgraceful. The standard room rate is around $300."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,5.0,"Very clean
Nice rooms"
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,"If you are expecting ""24/7 shuttle"" to actually mean that, then beware. They only run every 30 minutes, instead of constantly or upon request. Had to order a $35 uber while staring at the parked shuttle my $350 room was supposed to include.

This is not mentioned on the website or when I checked in."
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,What is the point of staying at a hotel that is close to the airport if the shuttle service that they provide fills up?
Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,"We had a nearly 30 hr flight from New Zealand. The flight got diverted to Washington DC and we finally got to the hotel 6 hrs late to find they had resold our fully paid room and we had no where to go. It was very poor service and reason why they sold our room. We have emailed and asked for our money back to be offered $24.
Not a great start to our holiday."

Hampton Inn NY-JFK,1.0,I had a delayed flight after midnight had to get room so my mom reserved a room she customer service was friendly over the phone they were able to accommodate me in allowed me to check in at 3am. I was exhausted from an LAX flight so I just laid down around 5 I woke up to a bed bug next to me I flicked it and jumped up called my mom and checked out. fortunately I didn‚Äôt have any luggage it‚Äôs with the connecting flight to BDL when I board tonight. Upon checking out I asked for a full refund I didn‚Äôt stay over 4 hours and they said they have to do investigation my mom told me to take a picture too unfortunately by flicking it I had no clue where the critter I‚Äôm totally grossed out.  My mom called the front desk and was told she would need to speak with management Randy who wasn‚Äôt available at the time for they took her name and number to return her call. We would like a full refund as I wasn‚Äôt able to enjoy my stay nor was I offered a different room nor any future accommodations. Delayed and exhausted in NYC/JFK.

Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"My stay here has been nothing short of amazing thanks to the incredible staff. From the moment I arrived, everyone went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and well taken care of.
Special thanks to Trechianna Hamilton, Mimi, ONicki, and Alejandra ‚Äî each of them truly made my time here unforgettable. They were friendly, attentive, and always willing to help with a smile.
It‚Äôs rare to come across a team that makes you feel this welcome and appreciated. Because of them, I‚Äôll definitely be recommending this place to friends and family, and I‚Äôll be looking forward to returning myself."

Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"I made an error and booked a wrong date for a stay of one night at Courtyard Marriott JFK, thru Booking.com. The check-in person was helpful and booked me a room once  I realized my error so I would have a place to stay and I paid them this second time. I called booking.com who was very helpful and they said they would email Courtyard Marriott to see if they would refund. I also followed up and called the manager, Camilla(?), explained to her my situation and said booking.com would have to call them and they should know that Courtyard Marriott doesn‚Äôt respond to email. Not a very helpful person. So I was on hold 30 minutes with booking.com, who was very helpful. They called Camilla (?) the manager at the hotel while I waited, came back on said Camilla said they would not refund. Very disappointed since although I made the error I paid another full night to them so the hotel would not have lost any money. And the manager could have told me they would not refund while I was talking to her. I will not stay here again."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,3.0,The hotel is run down though the staff keeps it very clean.  Breakfast was not   lncluded in the $250 a night room. The room air was at least 85% humidity so quite uncomfortable.  Shuttle service is convenient.  Certainly feels over priced for the facility.  But i guess you should be prepared to be ripped off in NYC.
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"After a long trip and exhausted I enjoyed my meal and the services I was given. My stay was extremely pleasant and the staff were amazing. My have the pleasure off meeting my server Alexandra. She was welcoming, extremely respectful and showed genuine interest in making certain that I was  ok at all time. Hopefully you all will experience the same."

Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"Unfortunately, in this hotel I had my worst reception service in my life. We got a reservation from an airline due to missing our connection flight.
The lady that tried to give us the room should really change her profession:
- took more than 30 minutes to try to find a room
- gave us occupied room by men TWICE. Imagine my shock entering a room with man inside after midnight with my kids. On the third time finally was an unoccupied room.
- gave us breakfast coupon but didn't explain that we could use it to take food and water at night for me and my children so she took it away. After I saw the rest of the airline passangers buy food at that moment ( they were attended by another receptionist) I had to go back and ask why she didn't let me know I could buy food now.
- worst was her attitude since the beginning. She was extremely unprofessional, rude, unresponsive, answering back with an attitude after all the situations she had put us throught.
- the reception time took more than an hour.
The positive things about the hotel I could tell were the nice shuttle driver, the ladies from the dinner/breakfast stand were nice, the third room I got was clean, and the close location to the airport.
But the receptionist will always leave me with the worst memory I've ever had in a hotel."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"When I arrived at the hotel after a long day of travel with my baby in tow, I was shocked to learn that the room I had prepaid for had been given away. The manager on duty showed little concern, and I was told bluntly over the phone that I‚Äôd be refunded and sent on my way. It was late, I was exhausted, and I had an infant who desperately needed rest and it was truly a nightmare scenario.

Enter Yolanda at the front desk, who completely turned this experience around.

Despite the lack of support from her leadership, Yolanda saw us, understood the situation, and refused to give up. She took it upon herself to find any solution. She dug deep, found us a room (even if it was in the middle of construction), and made sure we weren‚Äôt left out in the cold. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was a roof over our heads and in that moment, it meant everything.

Yolanda went above and beyond what most would do, especially in an industry where true compassion can sometimes be rare. Her empathy, determination, and problem-solving mindset made all the difference. She was a true lifesaver, and I will never forget her kindness.

Thank you, Yolanda, for caring when no one else did. This hotel is lucky to have you."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"Rooms are comfortable and good AC, but walls and doors very thin so anyone talking can be heard. Staff are extremely friendly."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"I was a little unsure of coming here based on the reviews but I have to say the negative reviews couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. The staff was super friendly to me and my parents who were also staying here, greeting us every time we walked in the lobby, or arrived at the entrance. The valet is super fast, and the front desk staff were always welcoming and helpful. The cleaning staff was excellent, I left a note in my room requesting additional towels and soap and when I returned to my room that night I was left with just what I requested. I would come back here again, great Bonvoy spot."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"I stayed one night at Courtyard New York JFK Airport with my family and booked two rooms. The rooms were clean, and the bathrooms were spotless ‚Äî which I really appreciated.

We arrived five hours before check-in time, but the front desk agent Tera was extremely helpful and did her best to get the rooms ready for us early. Check-in and check-out were both smooth and easy.

The front desk staff were friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better.

The airport shuttle service was excellent ‚Äî just keep in mind that you need to call the hotel to request it, which isn‚Äôt a problem if you know in advance.

I didn‚Äôt try the food at the hotel, but overall the stay was very comfortable.

I definitely recommend this hotel ‚Äî it‚Äôs close to JFK Airport, simple, clean, and reasonably priced for the value you get."

Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"I am totally disagree with this hotel for having a such a rude employee after a long trip we arrived for dinner and this waitress I think her name is Mimi totally rude,she treated us terribly bad manners never came back to the table after she drops the food we never see her again just when she throw the bill with the tip included
The thru is , i don‚Äôt understand how can a good standard hotel like this hired people like this with no education and no customer service skills at all"
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"I stay in Bonvoy hotels around JFK often but because of the horribly rude and inhospitable front desk employee, Michelle (if that‚Äôs her actual name). It was one of the two women working the morning of 7/23/2025. I have Ben a loyal Bonvoy member for years so I know great service from my previous experiences. Besides being so rude, she was the first employee I‚Äôve ever encountered who didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúThank you for being a Platinum Elite Member.‚Äù Not that I need to hear it but I knew from that combined with her rudeness that she doesn‚Äôt exude the Marriott brand. I will chose to stay at other Bonvoy properties instead. If you are using this hotel for DayUse, know that even though you pay for a room beginning at a certain time, the room may not even be ready if you arrive past that time. I had to wait along with two other customers. Inacceptable. I work in an industry where we continually apologize for situations that are beyond our control. It was so obvious that this employee couldn‚Äôt care less that our rooms were not ready when stated and we were tired from travels. There wasn‚Äôt any ‚Äúsorry for the inconvenience‚Äù or other words. No empathy.

But now that I‚Äôve read many of their 1-star reviews, it‚Äôs evident that they don‚Äôt care and nothing ever changes after they make their copy/paste reply to a review."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,"When I need a hotel by JFK, I like the Courtyard by Marriott, and eat at the Nosh! Restaurant for the vibes and the food. I had a great burger. What a treat.  Shout out to Alejandra, the bartender and server, who mixes a strong drink and makes weary air travelers feel welcome."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"As a loyal Marriott Rewards member since 2016 with close to 1,000 nights at Marriott facilities, I was appalled by the treatment my wife and I received during a recent stay here (12 July), where despite confirming our check-in via the Marriott app, we were informed upon our late-night arrival (by a very rude and badly dressed front desk manager) that no rooms were available‚Äî a scenario that left us literally sleeping on the floor of an unused meeting room before a flight the next day. The front desk‚Äôs explanation that mobile check-in is merely a ‚Äúrequest,‚Äù along with their inability to honor confirmed reservations for multiple guests, reflects a serious operational failure and disregard for customer loyalty. I have subsequently been given 20,000 points (after emailing the hotel directly to complain) but this does little to address the inconvenience we endured, and this experience has left me seriously rethinking my long-standing loyalty to the Marriott brand.  Please be wary that this hotel may just give your room away despite you trying to be proactive about your reservation and despite any level of loyalty to the brand!"
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"I stayed at this hotel for one night on Wednesday, July 9, and my experience was quite mixed.

Front Desk Service: Excellent

Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by the lady at the front desk, I believe her actual name was Lady or Laidys, and she was truly exceptional. She helped me sort out an issue with my reservation swiftly and even went above and beyond by giving me great recommendations for local dining. Her professionalism and kindness set a positive tone for my stay.

Restaurant Experience: Disappointing

Unfortunately, my experience at the hotel restaurant was the complete opposite. The waitress, Trechianna, was extremely rude and unprofessional. When I walked in, I wasn‚Äôt greeted at all‚Äîshe looked visibly irritated and simply asked, ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù in a very blunt manner.

After placing my order, I sat down at my table. The waitress brought the food but didn‚Äôt say a word‚Äîshe placed the plate on the table without any acknowledgment. Later, she returned and dropped the check on the table in a noticeably aggressive way, again without saying anything. I really wanted to order some dessert, but after dealing with such poor service, I decided to return to my room instead.

Room Conditions: Below Expectations

The room itself was visually clean but had several issues. There was a strong mold-like odor that was hard to ignore. The carpet felt sticky and damp, as though it hadn‚Äôt been properly rinsed after cleaning. Additionally, the air conditioning wasn‚Äôt functioning well, and the vents were covered in dust, making the room uncomfortable.

Overall Impression

While the front desk service was outstanding, the poor restaurant service and subpar room conditions significantly affected my overall experience. Unfortunately, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this property based on this visit unless these issues are addressed."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,Great place to stay before a flight!
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"Location is great for the airporters. The staff including the shuttle driver is very friendly. The rooms are clean. But the sliding door of the bathroom area is useless. :( no sound proof, if someone is in the shower there is no way you can sleep. :("

Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"If I could give it less than one star I would. Called for airport shuttle they said 10-15 min. Waited 20 and called again and she said he‚Äôs on the way and I said where and she said 10-15 min then hung up on me. No one came to get us so another hotels shuttle kindly dropped us off. The shuttle was sitting in front of our hotel when we got there, no one in it. On arrival no one was at front desk, had to call someone out. We asked about the shuttle and he said it was currently waiting for us at the airport- lie. I would never stay here."

Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,Very close to airport. Street parking. Very clean rooms.  Overpriced like all the other airport hotels in the area. But that's typical NY for you.
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,4.0,"My sister booked a room for one night since my niece is flying in the nearby airport. The room was clean and had comfortable pillows. The bathroom could use a stronger exhaust fan because it gets super steamy after a hot shower. The toilet also gets pretty loud when it flushes, just like in an airplane. The staff could use a little more friendly smiles. I want to give a shoutout to Junior for helping us with our luggage, and I think Terri for a smooth checkout. No issues encountered with the shuttle service. The shuttle does stop at multiple points and has to travel around a residential area, that‚Äôs why it takes longer for them to get to the airport or pickup point."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"Picked up by Pierre from JFK. This is where he left our bags. Checked in by Addy, who felt she was too good to hand me my card in my hand like I haven‚Äôt to her, and was told I had the double room I reserved. Went up to a king room. Came back down to get the double room only to find the door unlocked. MEDIOCRITY AT ITS FINEST!"
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"This was my first time visiting this place, and honestly, it was one of the worst experiences I've had in my 46 years.

The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. After finishing my meal, I tried to pay, but was told the card system was down and they were only accepting cash. Unfortunately, my card isn't a debit card, so I couldn't withdraw any money. I ended up stuck there for nearly two hours, just waiting around with no assistance from anyone.

No one made an effort to help or even check in on me.
It was shocking and frustrating.
For a mistake on their end, their attitude toward me as a customer was unbelievably indifferent.

I‚Äôm truly disappointed that something like this happened at a place that‚Äôs supposed to offer hospitality.
I will never return, and I cannot recommend this place to anyone."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,3.0,Great location if you are doing a park and stay. Room was ok! Service staff was helpful!
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,2.0,Subpar experience at check in and low standards for cleanliness and quality. Recommend using other hotels in the area.
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"Terrible experience with Dayuse.com and Courtyard JFK. Wrong shuttle picked us up, had to walk 2 blocks. Hotel then said they don‚Äôt accept Dayuse reservations. No help offered. We had to return to the airport and wait 7 hours. Total waste of time. Avoid both Dayuse and this hotel."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,3.0,"The room itself was fine, other than a noisy toilet that made a crazy suction sound louder than on the aircraft.

The check-in staff was friendly and efficient. Give them a 5.

The shuttle pickup, however, was a huge disappointment. Followed all the right steps, got to pickup at Federal Circle, called and was told shuttle was on the way. 50 minutes later it showed up. For a distance of about a mile and a half. Somebody took a break or drove REALLY slowly. Meanwhile, shuttles from every other nearby hotel stopped here, some even twice.

Breakfast options of things at the Nook were awful. Bagel having mold on it will not advertise well. There was a Dunkin just up the street, so we got a nice walk."

Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,"Our flight from Montr√©al into JFK was 2 hours late so we were on the ground after midnight and just six hours before we had to depart again for our return flight home.  The shuttle took forever to pick everyone up.  At the hotel we were able to check in fairly quickly, though I should have been able to check in electronically but of course, that feature on the app wasn‚Äôt working.  The room was ok and adequate for our very brief stay, but when we awoke at 5:45 AM, there was NO WATER in the bathroom.  The sink, shower and toilet were completely off.  We called the front desk (worthless waste of time) and they said they were ‚Äúaware of the problem and called a plumber.‚Äù  So, without a shower, a toilet flush or the ability to even brush our teeth, we hurried down to catch the 6:30 AM shuttle to JFK.  The shuttle was packed so we couldn‚Äôt get on and the driver told us the other shuttle driver never showed for work so it would likely be an hour before the only shuttle got back to pick us up.  We called an Uber and for $26 we got to the airport on time ‚Ä¶ no thanks to Marriott.  We were offered a 50% price reduction on our ‚Äúroom,‚Äù which was grossly overpriced to begin with.  We will dispute any charges for this debacle with our credit card company.  $350 + $26 for the Uber is simply unacceptable.  Worst experience ever.  ‚ÄúF-‚Äú to Marriott for no water, no shuttle and no responsibility-taking for their complete failure to deliver.  We‚Äôd have been better off trying to sleep in the airport.  At least they have running water."

Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,1.0,Very disappointed with the room issues. Got in really late and didn't realize the ac wasn't working properly until was going to sleep. Opened the window to allow some cool air in only to be woken up by early honking and trucks. Went to make coffee and the keurig in the room is broken. Went to take a shower and there was hair at the drain. The drain is also clogged sot the bathtub fills up. Now it's time to get breakfast and they charge $22 for a pathetic continental breakfast. This place is not worth the amount you will spend.

checked in around 11pm, they gave me keys to strangers room, we then woke up a very confused and naked guest walking into their room. we explained this to the front desk who said it ""was not a safe guarding issue"" lol. such a terrible experience.

rooms have terrible airflow, one semi warm shower makes the entire space damp and full of condensation.

no super fast wifi either, no laptop or ipad use."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,3.0,"Great hotel. However, the bistro is poor. Being a head chef in a Spanish Palace, our food was coming out of the kitchen luke warm even though no one else was dining at the time. The food was of low quality out of packets and extremely easy for someone to prepare for the overpriced meal. Only later did I see some leaflets near the reception of some local takeaways that I could of called."
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,3.0,"The best part of staying here is the convenient location near JFK Airport and the easy-to-use hotel shuttle service.

The room was quite small, but manageable for a short stay before catching a flight.
Suggestion for improvement: It would be great if the hotel could offer complimentary breakfast options to enhance the overall experience for guests."

The only downfall was the shuttle pick up from the airport that took over 45 minutes. But other than that everything was great we left our car there for 6 days. Thanks so much to the great staff!
Courtyard by Marriott New York JFK Airport,5.0,We had a harrowing day with two flights cancelled. One from JFK and then we rushed over to Newark and that flight was cancelled. We got dumped off by Lyft at the TWA door after midnight with NO ONE in sight. The hotel was very gracious but the highlight was our driver James. He turned it all around by his infectious personality and I can tell you he was the highlight of our day. More of that please Marriott. More James's!

Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,It‚Äôs a LOVE HOTEL (Motel)
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,If I could give a zero star I would. My experience was horrible. The blanket were stained and had cigarette burn in it. The whole hall smelled like Marijuana and cigarettes. There was a hole in the wall and no lock on the door. I stay for 2 nights no one never came to clean the room. If you are traveling with children do not go to this place the area is also sketchy.

Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"Est√°bamos buscando un sitio cerca del aeropuerto  para pasar unas horas hasta la salida del vuelo, y no nos detuvimos a mirar las rese√±as, una zona que a leguas se ve superpeligrosa, un hotel con malos olores y no sab√≠as si el que estaba en la habitacion de al lado te pod√≠a asaltar , la peor experiencia de nuestras vidas, lo √∫nico que puedo decir es que la chica de la recepci√≥n superamable incluso nos permiti√≥ el check in antes, pero alguien que cuide su vida no debe hospedarse ah√≠ es cuesti√≥n de seguridad."
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,5.0,"Upon reaching the doors the pergola hotel I'm always greeted by the excellent staff, me and my family never have to wait, it immediately check in, along with outstanding service, everything thing that I require when traveling to this hotel is met with exceptional standards, the only complaint that I can think of is I can't take the cleaning staff home with me."

Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"Absolutely Disgusting ‚Äì Do Not Stay Here

This hotel was an absolute nightmare. The second I walked in, I was hit with the overwhelming smell of cigarettes and bleach‚Äîa disgusting combo clearly trying to cover up something worse.

The comforter had burn holes, the curtains were stained, and the lampshade had nasty brown marks all over it. The desk chair was completely torn and bubbling, and the walls had visible damage, holes, and stains like someone ripped d√©cor off and never bothered to fix it. It was just gross.

I showed the front desk photos, and they didn‚Äôt seem fazed at all. No apology‚Äîjust offered to move me to another room like this is totally normal. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not.

To top it all off, the state rating posted on the door was a D. A D. That says everything you need to know.

If you value cleanliness, safety, or basic human decency‚Äîavoid this place at all costs."

Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"Absolutely disgusting, room was filled with black mold, bathroom handle fell right off, cigarette holes in 1970 Comforter. Pillows flat pancakes!"
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"I‚Äôm convinced all the customers that have left 5 star reviews and 10/10 are the owners. THEY HAVE BED BUGS!!!!! If you don‚Äôt want the worries of carrying something home with you, don‚Äôt book here. There‚Äôs ash all over the walls, gum on the mirrors. Bath tub was dirty. Just NO ALL ACROSS THE BOARD. The only positive is the location."
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,This place is filthy! The lady at the front desk charged me $50 in cash to check in early and didn‚Äôt give me a receipt. I‚Äôm sure the $50 went in her pocket. The sheets on the bed had holes in them. The lock on door look like someone removed it . There were no towels in my room when I first walked in . They had 1 universal iron and board for the whole hotel. A man inside of the hotel was selling weed. The pictures online look nothing like the actual room ! Please don‚Äôt stay here .
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,4.0,<NA>
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,3.0,<NA>
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,4.0,"First and foremost as you walk into the entrance you are greeted with a stunning scent of weed.
I was disappointed with the room, the amenities, the no service behavior. Asked for a clean by using my cell phone as there is no phone in the room, still awaiting that towel days after my departure. The noise in hallways is horrible.....soundproof rooms? Nope. I'll never go here again, I don't recommend."
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"I had to call the front desk because there's roaches in my room, secondly the toilet is unable to flush, most of the lights don't work. The tv is a piece of scrap. I've had to call the front desk multiple times before they send someone out to look at the tv, so for this reason im giving it a 1 star"
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,Most disgusting place please don‚Äôt come here
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"I tried calling to book a room, due to a cancelled flight. She said she had one available, but said she wouldn't give it to me until I was there? I offered to pay for it, but she just hung up on me. Dreadful customer service."
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"Do not go there it is terrible place, the rooms are not clean  there is cigarette holes everywhere, stains, drug and cigarette  smell and they would not refund you if you asked  to cancel. The reception are rude and when you try  to speak  with the manager  they inform you that the management is based in India.
Don't ho there, no one that has respect to their  health and hygiene should  go there."
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"I will Never Never Never ever recommend any one to stay at this hotel ,the worst experience I ever had in my life,they said its non smoking property, the room smell like cigarette smoke,and smells so bad, and they wanted me to stay with my 3 years old daughter until next day to change the room, they charged me $650 for non staying in the hotel even 10 minutes, I asked them for cancelation, they refused , the pictures explained everything, I will sue them for sure,this place needs to be investigated and shut down."
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"This place is disgusting. DO NOT stay here. The rooms smell like cigarette smoke. Just the smell was so bad that it triggered my asthma. Everything is filthy. There were stains all over the curtains, the towels, and the comforter. There were drawings on the walls and crumbs and black stuff on the night stand. An absolute dump. Also so much noise all night. Please don‚Äôt stay here. It was terrible."
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,5.0,Really worth it i really love the room service nd its so good i enjoy the view
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,5.0,Big tv nice rooms excellent staff!! I come often!
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,5.0,"Nice h√¥tel, good place. Clean. Free parking. Beautiful h√¥tel. Every Time I come in New York I stay in this h√¥tel. Big Tv , wifi very good"
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"I‚Äôll never stay here and would never suggest this place. Unfortunately I booked with Expedia, only checked their reviews, and never checked Google reviews. Expedia has a VERY inaccurate rating! They have them marked with a 4 star rating. Google reviews have them with 2 stars. After my experience I read all reviews & the higher rated reviews sound like robots/fake paid account reviews. They sound like the same person wrote them. So I‚Äôm going to take a lucky guess the people at this place are spending their day submitting fake reviews to boost their rating, because there is no way this place should be rated more than a 1-2 star. I personally wouldn‚Äôt even give it that. I would give it a big FAT ZERO STARS.
First, It‚Äôs on a very loud busy corner in Jamaica Queens. No hotel parking so you need to find parking on the street. When you find parking you have to hurry with your bags across the busy streets before the crossing sign quickly changes. As you walk in you smell the strong stench of smoke and marajuana. There‚Äôs a front desk with one worker behind bullet proof glass, there are 2 drink machines that only take cash, and an atm. The atm is there for decoration apparently, because if you needed cash it was ‚Äúout of service‚Äù. I made a quick stop to my room to make sure my keycard worked and left because I had somewhere to be. When I got back it was towards the end of the day. The closet was very small with an iron holder on its door, but no iron. There was NO phone in the room, the door lock was useless and if someone had a keycard they could just walk in. The room had stains splattered literally everywhere, ripped & stained curtains, dirty light switches, dirty ac system, and a dirty fridge that had the shelves taken out. The room was so dark! One lamp that barely lit the room and was in extremely poor shape. I had a food platter from when I was out that I had to prop up with the ice bucket turned upside down in the fridge in order to chill my food and be able to still close the the fridge all the way. If I didn‚Äôt do this my plate wouldn‚Äôt fit because there was no shelves. There was sketchy holes over the shower & bed, dirty walls, and the room smelled of smoke even though it was non smoking. To make it worse, a fire hazard because they dangerously had the smoke detector covered with plastic. I assume to keep it from going off repeatedly with the smell. So if there was a real fire you wouldn‚Äôt be notified because the detector was tampered with and theres no phone in the room to get a warning call. If it was left by a previous customer then that just tells me even more they didn‚Äôt clean the room if they didn‚Äôt see that. Also disgustingly dirty bedding and missing comforter. I had to walk all the way back down to the front desk since there was no phone for me to call for room service. She said they would send someone up. It was over an hr later that a gentlemen wearing gloves came to my room and handed me bedding, HANDED ME, the bedding. I guess I was suppose to change out the soiled sheets myself and put on new ones after he admitted the sheets on the bed were supposedly cleaned by him, but ‚Äújust stained‚Äù. Lies! He then noticed I was missing the comforter and went to get one. He came back to my door with a rolled up ball of comforter. Everything in this room screamed RUN. The hotel offered me another room but I wouldn‚Äôt get it until the next day, which means I would have to stay in a filthy room. I didn‚Äôt want another dirty room and declined. Their second option was to send housekeeping up, which made no sense because he literally just left my room having done NOTHING. My last option was to cancel my reservation. I did!
I contacted Expedia as I had purchased insurance during booking. They tried for days to get ahold of the hotel and when they finally got them they refused a refund because they have a no refund policy, even though they ABSOLUTELY DID NOT PROVIDE THE SERVICE ADVERTISED. This place is so gross they need to be reported to the better business bureau. I‚Äôm now filing a claim with Expedia."
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"Hell to the NOOOOO! I would never come back in my godforsaken life. First off, me and my fiance get there there is no parking only STREET parking so good luck if you have a car. We get there, the front desk does not get there until 5 minutes later, get the room key and head upstairs. When we go to the room, there is a cracked MIRROR, walls are plastered with mold and black stuff, bathroom paint was cracked. Tub, was so digusting and the worst part, when I was washing my fiance's hair we were wondering why the sink did not want to go down. GUESS WHY???? There was a clump of someone's hair in the drain, and it was stuck that he pulled it out with his bare hands I felt like gagging. Then, when we get to the bed part because we were both tired the bed felt we were sitting on box springs, so squeaky so NOO. I will never ever, come back here only if I could get a refund, that would be great! Please I beg of you, even if you are desperate DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,5.0,"Very nice hotel, clean staff is so nice ."
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,First of all the pictures about even with the rules look like second of the people at the front desk are very rude the rooms are tiny like air doesn't work that they're nasty they're not clean then they don't want to move you to another room or accommodate I would never come here again I had to stay the night in a room with no air the guy kept coming up and saying that the air was working but it keeps coming on and shutting off and there was nothing done to accommodate me last night

Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,To start the place smells like cigarettes. The desk was no help. Overall bad experience here. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend!
Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,"This hotel should not be in business, the conditions of this place are horrible, to start the smell of mold and humidity throughout the building. Part of the bathroom ceiling failing off, the shower leaking. The constant smell of mold. The cigarette burns on the bed covers, the brown/yellow stains on the pillows and sheets. And the cherry on top the illegal covering of the smoke detectors which under NYC law is illegal. Ask for a refund and it was denied, was offered another room which naturally I did not accept due to it being in similar conditions. Refund was not given because its is ‚Äúnot their policy‚Äù, Expedia were no help at all. Will be making a call to 311 and NYC health code department."

Hotel Pergola JFK Airport,1.0,Safety is Horrible. A stranger knocked my door repeatedly and I informed the reception desk that I would like to file a safety complaint but she totally ignored and was trying to give blame to me which was shockingly ridiculous and scary.

Kin‚Äôd,4.0,The outdoor seating was so pretty and food was amazing. Everything was honestly perfect until towards the end we felt kinda rushed out. They didn‚Äôt ask to see if we wanted another round of drinks or if we wanted to see the dessert menu which I actually wanted to. They just came up to the table and placed the check on the table immediately. I don‚Äôt know if it was because we were sitting outside or she was new but that put a bad taste in my mouth. We really enjoy the food but we didn‚Äôt like the feeling of being rushed out after we just put our forks down.

Kin‚Äôd,2.0,I ordered the tom yum noodle soup. I received just tom yum soup. I asked for the missing noodles. The waitress very rudely repeated what she think she heard. An order she didn't write down. Then charged me for the noodles. Then ignored my table for the rest of the dinner. I paid $35 for tom yum noodle soup. Just an unpleasant experience.

Kin‚Äôd,3.0,"Friendly staff but enough salt to kill a horse or  raise your BP, it burns your throat and though i had all my dishes mild, the food was inappropriately salty, shocking that in this day and age there is zero regard for the terrible side effects eating sooooooooooooooooo much sodium  can have. Beimg  aware of what you are eating is one thing that has a profound effect on your health and wellbeing now and for many years to come. In conclusion the damage is not worth the pleasure. Personally I am having strong belly spasms after having had dinner there"

We ordered a mix of appetizers, a few chef‚Äôs specials, curry, and desserts, and everything was super flavorful. I especially loved the duck over rice and the Bangkok minced basil!

Overall, the service was friendly and fast, prices were fair, which made the whole dining experience enjoyable. I‚Äôd love to come back once again."

Kin‚Äôd,2.0,"I order from this restaurant once in a while and I usually get the same thing each time (that being the drunken noodles). Well, I did the same today and on the Uber Eats app I asked for the spice level to be 'spicy', NOT 'thai spicy' as that one is the spiciest level. I just wanted the regular spicy that I ALWAYS get. Next thing you know, my mouth is on fire, I feel nauseous and dizzy, and my nose is like a waterfall. I have never had that experience with this restaurant until today and again, I order the same thing every time. Honestly, this was traumatizing and I will not be ordering from here ever again."

Kin‚Äôd,2.0,"The wings and the vegetable dumplings were soggy. Also the green curry, although I asked for mild was extremely spicy. Nobody wants soggy wings and dumplings. Also, if this was their mild green curry, I can‚Äôt imagine what spicy is. Also, what was very peculiar about their wings is that it was hard to find much chicken on the wing. It was mostly breading."
Kin‚Äôd,5.0,"Met with my work family. Love my  future admin leaders and I love the food at Kin‚Äôd. Lunch was delicious. Got the drunken noodle , can‚Äôt go wrong with that. A bit spicy but worth the heat. Mojitos were delicious ."
Kin‚Äôd,4.0,"Food was good 8/10, portions were small 6/10 and drinks were amazing 9/10

7/10 would order again, my recommendation is to go spicy."
Kin‚Äôd,5.0,"Kin‚Äôd is always great! Whether dining in or getting takeout, the food is consistently tasty. Their wings, drunken noodles, and pad Thai are my go-to dishes‚Äîthey never disappoint. Service is friendly and quick too. Highly recommend!"
Kin‚Äôd,5.0,Very good
Kin‚Äôd,5.0,"Authentic Thai cuisine at its best! The flavors were rich, balanced, and truly reminded me of Thailand. The cocktails were not only delicious but also beautifully crafted ‚Äî almost too pretty to drink. Highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for a genuine Thai dining experience with stunning drinks."
Kin‚Äôd,1.0,"The food and the price is just average, however the service could be better, we didn't even finish the food and they are already rushing to take away our utensils and plates as if they are trying to get us to leave.  We weren't even there for an hour, and the restaurant was pretty empty at the time."
Kin‚Äôd,5.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant with delicious Thai food. It‚Äôs a hidden gem! It was very busy but seating was quick. Would definitely visit again. Lots of vegetarian meals.
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,4.0,The rooms are nice. No breakfast unless you pay extra. Valet parking on premises otherwise park on the street at your own risk

Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,"Terrible booking experience. My family booked a room for 2 kings and a pullout. When we arrive, they tell us that they're sold out of rooms for the night, even though we made a reservation (they claim there was a leak in the room and it's wasn't ready, allegedly). So the desk girl and the manager tried to ""upgrade"" us to 2 doubles and a pullout for the same price, no discount even given all their mistakes (another helpful deskman gave us a discount as we checked out).

The wonderful room we ""upgraded"" to had a broken window shade with a lovely ground level view of the parking lot, as well as a loose sink faucet.

I also overheard guests complaining about the same issues with not getting the room they booked almost every time I walked by the front desk. At least 3 groups did not get the room they originally reserved"
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,3.0,<NA>
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,"Horrible room and hotel. One of the worst Marriott properties I‚Äôve been to.  First room they put us in didn‚Äôt have any lights.  Yup, just screws coming out of the wall. They switched us to another room where the blinds didn‚Äôt work, which in some ways was a positive because any room that has the sofa bed is ground floor, facing a dark parking lot.  My kids are terrified and don‚Äôt want to sleep here.  Additionally, one of the cleaners must have spilt bleach in the bathroom because the toilet is surrounded by a fluorescent lime green stain on brown wallpaper.  Managements ‚Äúsolution‚Äù is to rent an extra room for $300/night.  Really wish in the room description they would have said ground floor room.  If you need the extra space steer clear of this hotel."

Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,5.0,Habitaciones limpias y buen servicio.
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,"Absolutely terrible and nightmare experience. There was zero customer service, no management presence, and the front desk staff were extremely unprofessional, rude, and even hostile.

Our booking was canceled without our consent by the front desk staff member, Shania, simply because we asked to view the room before our check-in day. She became upset when my husband asked for her name and the manager‚Äôs name ‚Äî and shockingly, she turned around, canceled our reservation, slammed the door, filmed us, and even called the police on us for no reason.

She completely ruined our wedding plans and caused me to have a mental breakdown the day before our wedding. We contacted Marriott customer service, who agreed the situation was unacceptable and said they would escalate the case since there was no manager on site.

What‚Äôs worse ‚Äî they told us the room was booked by someone else after the cancellation, but in reality, Shania held it for over an hour. We had no choice but to rebook it ourselves due to all the money and time already spent on our wedding.

The room itself was in horrible condition: no maintenance, stains everywhere, peeling walls, and even visible blood stains on the wall next to the toilet. Absolutely disgusting and beyond unacceptable.

This was one of the worst experiences we've ever had, especially during such an important time in our lives. Completely unacceptable and outrageous for a Marriott property.

We‚Äôve called Marriott customer service multiple times, and each time they told us the case would be escalated. Yet to this day, no one from upper management has reached out to us.

I eventually received an email from the front desk supervisor, but her tone made it clear that they have no intention of taking any real action. It honestly felt like they just don‚Äôt care at all.

If you work in customer service ‚Äî especially in the hospitality industry ‚Äî you should lead with heart, empathy, and professionalism. Sadly, this experience showed none of that."
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,5.0,The reception and check in was perfect and prompt. The rooms were of good size with all basic facilities. I see most of the hotels don't provide bathroom toiletries. Beds were comfortable. The issue is the road side rooms have noise of vehicles passing fast on the express way. The AC was also making noise. Location is away from all the places including subway stations. Very few buses stand nearby.

Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,"Absolutely the Worst Hotel Experience I've Ever Had!

I had a terrible experience at Courtyard New York Queens/Fresh Meadows and feel compelled to share so others don‚Äôt make the same mistake. I called ahead to confirm that if I wanted my room ready for Friday morning, I should book starting Thursday night. I followed this exact instruction and even asked the staff member on the phone if there was anything else I needed to do‚Äîshe said no.

When I arrived Friday morning, the front desk supervisor told me they had given my room away because I was marked as a ""no-show"" the night before. They didn‚Äôt bother to call, email, or contact me in any way to confirm or inquire about my reservation. To make matters worse, they were completely sold out for the weekend.

The supervisor was extremely rude and unprofessional, offering zero help or empathy. While they refunded my money (which was the bare minimum), they refused to compensate for the additional Uber trip I had to make while scrambling to find another hotel for my family that same day.

I've stayed at countless hotels over the years, and I can confidently say this was the WORST experience I‚Äôve ever had. Poor communication, lack of accountability, and downright disrespectful service. Stay far away from this hotel."
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,4.0,Great stay. Excellent service. Just wish our room was in the back of the hotel. Really didn't rest well with all the highway noise. But hey..it NY.
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,This is one of the worst Marriots there's no  service and when you do find a staff member they act like your disturbing them and agitating them. Only good thing was only had to stay one night!!!

Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,"A Nightmare Experience Before Our Wedding

My wife and I booked an executive suite at this Marriott Courtyard for our wedding. Naturally, we wanted to check the room in advance to make sure it would be suitable for such an important occasion. We made four separate requests just to view the suite, and each time we were denied.

On our last attempt, the situation escalated to a shocking level. A front desk agent named Shania H. not only threatened to cancel our reservation, but also called the police on me. That interaction was shocking, humiliating, unnecessary, and completely inappropriate.

My wife was devastated. The day before our wedding, she was in tears, thinking everything we had planned was falling apart. Instead of being excited for our big day, we were dealing with fear, stress, and embarrassment caused entirely by how this hotel handled a simple customer request.

This experience was a complete nightmare. I‚Äôve never been treated like this at any hotel‚Äîlet alone at a Marriott, which we expected to be professional and accommodating. There was no empathy, no communication, and no effort to make things right.

I sincerely hope Marriott management takes a serious look at how their staff treats guests, especially during important life events. No one should be treated this way‚Äîever."
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,3.0,"Very small hotel, the king size room was smaller than I expected. Laundry room was $5 to wash and $5 to dry only one washer and one dryer, used only coins and the front desk will tell you they don't have any, both gas stations are within walking distance and complained that the hotel customers are always coming by for quarters.

Disappointed at this Marriott hotel.

Plus side, 15 mins from LGA airport."
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,5.0,Very professional staff. They were quick to help with whatever we needed and were extremely kind. We had an excellent stay
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,5.0,Flights got cancelled and this hotel is a 10 minute uber to LGA!
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,"DO NOT STAY HERE. We are platinum elite members and have stayed at Marriots all over the world and this location is by far the worse stay we ever had. The location is terrible, situated right along a very busy expressway. The odd room numbers are located on that side of the hotel, it was loud and not restful at all.  The outside was dirty as was the glass and doors. The morning caf√© was not opened as promised for coffee and light breakfast. They barely put out a carafe of coffee when people were complaining. This was a Sunday, and the day of a graduation ceremony for a local University and it was packed. Not prepared at all for the high volume and/or could not care to.  You will be better off staying next door at the Fairfield, if you have to stay at this location. It had better accommodations and most likely it's properly managed. A very disappointing experience."
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,3.0,"Unfortunately, my stay here fell short of expectations. When I arrived, there was no valet in sight‚ÄîI waited over 40 minutes for someone to return so I could receive my ticket. At check-in, the room key system was down, so I wasn‚Äôt given a key for the entire first day. A hotel staff member ended up leaving my door ajar while I waited for the valet, which was unsettling, especially knowing the room had been left open for about an hour. To top it off, my room was never cleaned during my stay. I'm not sure if housekeeping only operates on select days, but in my case, it was missed entirely."
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,5.0,Nice spot but no parking valet only which you have to pay for
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,4.0,"It was not a bad place to stay. However, there was constant noise from the next room. Also the toilet in the room was leaking at the seal point."
Courtyard by Marriott New York Queens/Fresh Meadows,1.0,Had a very bad experience at this location to sleep in my vehicle 2 hours before checkin was told by the front desk when it was time to check in that they didn't accept chimes credit card not chimes debit card but chimes credit card trip was booked days before checkin came from another state felt very disrespected and humiliated had to to search for another location to stay and the most disrespectful thing I was attending a funeral and was rejected by this hotel lost my explorer discount had to pay top rate in order to stay at another location only was able to stay one day with my family to celebrate my family's homegoing. Very disrespectful and unprofessional by this staff nothing complimentary coming from another state I felt very disrespected and like a bum on the streets as well as homeless by the way I was treated by this staff.

DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,4.0,It was very nice staying in Double Tree by Hilton. They have a very neat and clean environment.

DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,1.0,"This morning, the driver screamed at us and dropped us at Terminal 5, even though we clearly asked to be dropped at Terminal 1. I am pregnant and traveling with two young children, yet he shouted, ‚ÄúI HAVE A JOB TO DO, just walk to T1.‚Äù We booked this hotel and paid $300 specifically to ensure an easy and pleasant trip home. Instead, we were forced to walk 30 minutes with four bags and two kids. This was extremely stressful and unacceptable."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,3.0,"Stayed here recently due to a delayed flight. The shuttle service is convenient. The front desk staff was okay but not necessarily friendly, the dinner was okay, but the room did not feel very clean at all. Hairs in the shower and splattered liquids throughout the hardwood floors. In addition, we had someone banging on our door at 2am claiming to be following up with us on a taxi service‚Ä¶that we never requested. Of course we didn‚Äôt open the door and left immediately for the hotel in the morning. Overall, wouldn‚Äôt recommend."

DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,2.0,This was the worst customer service experience I've had at a hotel...from have to beg staff to clean rooms and leave extra towels to being over charged for parking that we never received. Now playing phone tag trying to get reimbursed for being over charged has been a nightmare. Leadership sucks and does nothing. Im now looking for corporate complaint info to sound the alarm. Stay somewhere else!
DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,5.0,"My spouse and I stayed prior to an international flight out of JFK, using the stay and park package. We couldn't have been more pleased with our experience at DoubleTree. The hotel itself has been recently renoated, and the room was exceptioanlly clean. We had zero issues in dropping or retrieving our car from the valet, and the service at the hotel bar was lovely. The gym is workable and convenient.

A few tips for a successful stay:
Note that this is an urban hotel very close to an airport; while the latent noise did not impact our stay, you may wish to plan ahead of a pin-drop quiet room is a must.
The property is valet parking only; be sure to follow the guidance that is shared by the property, and call ahead when you're ready to retrieve your vehicle.
The airport shuttle was on-time and predictable for us during our stay. I encourage you to take a picture of the instructions on the shuttle if you'll be returning a car; they were clear, easy to follow, and helped ensure we got to the right place at the right time to catch out shuttle back."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,1.0,"I regret staying here as a family with 3 small children with 4 pieces of luggage and 2 car seats, to find that they had no luggage carts and no ability to store luggage for us (and were unfriendly about it). The location is really inconvenient as you need to take the Air train and then a shuttle and there is not much to do (or eat) within walking distance. Just don't expect Hilton standards if you stay here."

DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,1.0,"Utilized their parking.  Upon arrival, valet attendant suggested we take a taxi rather than advertised free shuttle.  We took the VERY overcrowded shuttle.  Upon pick up. Driver arrived within 10 minutes but said he had to make 1 more stop.  That extra stop turned the 7 minute ride into 30 minutes as he circled the entire airport. Picked up flight crew at Terminal 8, drove past the Federal Circle original pickup (without stopping) and then went to hotel. Absolutely infuriating after a day of travel and that 30 minutes put us into NY rush hour.   ."

DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,3.0,"The service was fine and the staff friendly. However, not a sign of warm cookies.

DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,3.0,Just for a night. Flight lost
DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,1.0,"My stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing due to the unprofessional staff and awful service.

First, the hotel shuttle was nearly impossible to catch. I waited for a long time, and when I tried calling the hotel multiple times for assistance, no one answered the phone. This lack of communication and unreliable transportation caused unnecessary stress.

Upon arrival, the front desk staff were shockingly rude. I simply asked if I could leave my luggage for a short while, but they refused without any courtesy or explanation. The attitude was unacceptable‚Äîhospitality should be a basic standard for any hotel.

I would not recommend this place to anyone. Poor shuttle service, unresponsive staff, and terrible customer service made my experience miserable.  de Staff and Poor Service."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,3.0,"Stayed May 2025. We were grateful for the staff of this establishment more than anything. They were kind and considerate and we really appreciated it. Now, the shareholders and corporation on the other hand need to be told that their establishment is far too much money, for them to not maintain and replace and or repair their electrical system. We could not steam a gown and blow an air dryer at the same time, without all the lights going out in the room ! To include the TV JUST SHUTTING OFF! We had to call the maintenance staff to come reboot it twice! And then we had to wait for one to finish hair so the other could steam a dress for an event. Ultimately, at almost 200 dollars a night, that is incredibly unacceptable from the building and I was not happy at all. The staff did their best to fix it and we just made it work. I also don't feel like the parking was adequate; while the staff for the valet were very awesome, it was ridiculous that we were not able to park near the hotel without having to walk from somewhere inside the neighborhood- in a gown no less coming from a formal event, had we not paid for the valet.
We again, appreciated all the staff, the room was clean, a very typical room, nothing overtly fancy and check in and out was swift. The heads of Doubletree and Hilton in general need to update their buildings, they more than have the funds."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,3.0,"The staff is friendly but not overly motivated. The shuttle service is a chaotic mess from a process perspective. I would not rely too much on it and calculate with lots of extra time.
The room itself was all right but the windows are virtually not existant and you hear a lot of street noise."
DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,1.0,Shuttle service was horrible.  This hotel is not far from the hotel i think 10 minutes tops.  We were at the pickup location at the airport Federal Drive at 1:00 i called the hotel to request shuttle service to the hotel because i parked my car there.  I was told the shuttle would be to us in 15 to 20 minutes.  Well 15 to 20 minutes turned into 2 hours.  We watched other shuttles for other hotels come and go but no DoubleTree shuttle.  After while there was so many people waiting.  I called the hotel several times after my 1st call and got answers like he will be there in 5 minutes next call 10 minutes.  Needless to say the shuttle didn't come until after 3pm.  This is ridiculous and unacceptable and I will never park here again.
DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,1.0,Shuttle took over an hour for pickup! Rude people. Looks convenient to the airport but 2 hours after you land you might actually checkin
DoubleTree by Hilton New York JFK Airport,2.0,This room is clean and modern and then you realize that the air handler in the room belongs in a motel 7.

Ao entrar no restaurante fomo surpreendidos pela informa√ß√£o de que os valores n√£o eram acumulativos‚Ä¶ e no menu a √∫nica op√ß√£o de 12,00 j√° n√£o tinha mais‚Ä¶ foi quando o gerente Sr Andrew veio explicar a regra de maneira extremamente deselegante, mal educada‚Ä¶sem paci√™ncia, como se n√≥s estiv√©ssemos incomodando‚Ä¶jogou os vouchers na mesa com grosseria.. como se j√° n√£o tiv√©ssemos passando chatea√ß√£o o suficiente‚Ä¶ alterando um voo, perdendo dia de trabalho em nosso pa√≠s e todos os outros compromissos advindos da mudan√ßa de planos! Por fim chegou uma atendente do restaurante de nome Rehana que foi √≥tima e aparentemente a √∫nica pessoa educada do sal√£o a nos dar aten√ß√£o e atendimento coerente! Uma pena! Enfim uma
Dica para quando um
Hotel buscar um profissional‚Ä¶ pergunte se ele gosta de PESSOAS!"
